      "       --no-install-recommends\n           Do not consider recommended packages as a dependency for\n           installing. Configuration Item: APT::Install-Recommends.\n\n       -d, --download-only\n           Download only; package files are only retrieved, not unpacked or\n           installed. Configuration Item: APT::Get::Download-Only.\n\n       -f, --fix-broken\n           Fix; attempt to correct a system with broken dependencies in place.\n           This option, when used with install/remove, can omit any packages\n           to permit APT to deduce a likely solution. If packages are\n           specified, these have to completely correct the problem. The option\n           is sometimes necessary when running APT for the first time; APT\n           itself does not allow broken package dependencies to exist on a\n           system. It is possible that a system's dependency structure can be\n           so corrupt as to require manual intervention (which usually means\n           using dselect(1) or dpkg --remove to eliminate some of the\n           offending packages). Use of this option together with -m may\n           produce an error in some situations. Configuration Item:\n           APT::Get::Fix-Broken.\n\n       -m, --ignore-missing, --fix-missing\n           Ignore missing packages; If packages cannot be retrieved or fail\n           the integrity check after retrieval (corrupted package files), hold\n           back those packages and handle the result. Use of this option\n           together with -f might produce an error in some situations. If a\n           package is selected for installation (particularly if it is\n           mentioned on the command line) and it could not be downloaded then\n           it will be silently held back. Configuration Item:\n           APT::Get::Fix-Missing.\n\n       --no-download\n           Disables downloading of packages. This is best used with\n           --ignore-missing to force APT to use only the .debs it has already\n           downloaded. Configuration Item: APT::Get::Download.\n\n       -q, --quiet\n           Quiet; produces output suitable for logging, omitting progress\n           indicators. More q's will produce more quiet up to a maximum of 2.\n           You can also use -q=# to set the quiet level, overriding the\n           configuration file. Note that quiet level 2 implies -y, you should\n           never use -qq without a no-action modifier such as -d, --print-uris\n           or -s as APT decided to do something you did not expect.\n           Configuration Item: quiet.\n\n       -s, --simulate, --just-print, --dry-run, --recon, --no-act\n           No action; perform a simulation of events that would occur but do\n           not actually change the system. Configuration Item:\n           APT::Get::Simulate.\n\n           Simulation run as user will deactivate locking (Debug::NoLocking)\n           automatic. Also a notice will be displayed indicating that this is\n           only a simulation, if the option\n           APT::Get::Show-User-Simulation-Note is set (Default: true). Neither\n           NoLocking nor the notice will be triggered if run as root (root\n           should know what he is doing without further warnings by apt-get).\n\n           Simulate prints out a series of lines each one representing a dpkg\n           operation, Configure (Conf), Remove (Remv), Unpack (Inst). Square\n           brackets indicate broken packages and empty set of square brackets\n           meaning breaks that are of no consequence (rare).\n\n       -y, --yes, --assume-yes\n           Automatic yes to prompts; assume \"yes\" as answer to all prompts and\n           run non-interactively. If an undesirable situation, such as\n           changing a held package, trying to install a unauthenticated\n           package or removing an essential package occurs then apt-get will\n           exit. Configuration Item: APT::Get::Assume-Yes.\n\n       -u, --show-upgraded\n           Show upgraded packages; Print out a list of all packages that are\n           to be upgraded. Configuration Item: APT::Get::Show-Upgraded.\n\n       -V, --verbose-versions\n           Show full versions for upgraded and installed packages.\n           Configuration Item: APT::Get::Show-Versions.\n\n       -b, --compile, --build\n           Compile source packages after downloading them. Configuration Item:\n           APT::Get::Compile.\n\n       --install-recommends\n           Also install recommended packages.\n\n       --no-install-recommends\n           Do not install recommended packages.\n\n       --ignore-hold\n           Ignore package Holds; This causes apt-get to ignore a hold placed\n           on a package. This can be useful in conjunction with dist-upgrade\n           to override a large number of undesired holds. Configuration Item:\n           APT::Ignore-Hold.\n\n       --no-upgrade\n           Do not upgrade packages; When used in conjunction with install,\n           no-upgrade will prevent packages on the command line from being\n           upgraded if they are already installed. Configuration Item:\n           APT::Get::Upgrade.\n\n       --force-yes\n           Force yes; This is a dangerous option that will cause apt to\n           continue without prompting if it is doing something potentially\n           harmful. It should not be used except in very special situations.\n           Using force-yes can potentially destroy your system! Configuration\n           Item: APT::Get::force-yes.\n\n       --print-uris\n           Instead of fetching the files to install their URIs are printed.\n           Each URI will have the path, the destination file name, the size\n           and the expected md5 hash. Note that the file name to write to will\n           not always match the file name on the remote site! This also works\n           with the source and update commands. When used with the update\n           command the MD5 and size are not included, and it is up to the user\n           to decompress any compressed files. Configuration Item:\n           APT::Get::Print-URIs.\n\n       --purge\n           Use purge instead of remove for anything that would be removed. An\n           asterisk (\"*\") will be displayed next to packages which are\n           scheduled to be purged.  remove --purge is equivalent to the purge\n           command. Configuration Item: APT::Get::Purge.\n\n       --reinstall\n           Re-Install packages that are already installed and at the newest\n           version. Configuration Item: APT::Get::ReInstall.\n\n       --list-cleanup\n           This option defaults to on, use --no-list-cleanup to turn it off.\n           When on apt-get will automatically manage the contents of\n           /var/lib/apt/lists to ensure that obsolete files are erased. The\n           only reason to turn it off is if you frequently change your source\n           list. Configuration Item: APT::Get::List-Cleanup.\n\n       -t, --target-release, --default-release\n           This option controls the default input to the policy engine, it\n           creates a default pin at priority 990 using the specified release\n           string. This overrides the general settings in\n           /etc/apt/preferences. Specifically pinned packages are not affected\n           by the value of this option. In short, this option lets you have\n           simple control over which distribution packages will be retrieved\n           from. Some common examples might be -t '2.1*', -t unstable or -t\n           sid. Configuration Item: APT::Default-Release; see also the\n           apt_preferences(5) manual page.\n\n       --trivial-only\n           Only perform operations that are 'trivial'. Logically this can be\n           considered related to --assume-yes, where --assume-yes will answer\n           yes to any prompt, --trivial-only will answer no. Configuration\n           Item: APT::Get::Trivial-Only.\n\n       --no-remove\n           If any packages are to be removed apt-get immediately exits\n           without prompting. Configuration Item: APT::Get::Remove.\n\n       --auto-remove\n           If the command is either install or remove, then this option acts\n           like running autoremove command, removing the unused dependency\n           packages. Configuration Item: APT::Get::AutomaticRemove.\n\n       --only-source\n           Only has meaning for the source and build-dep commands. Indicates\n           that the given source names are not to be mapped through the binary\n           table. This means that if this option is specified, these commands\n           will only accept source package names as arguments, rather than\n           accepting binary package names and looking up the corresponding\n           source package. Configuration Item: APT::Get::Only-Source.\n\n       --diff-only, --dsc-only, --tar-only\n           Download only the diff, dsc, or tar file of a source archive.\n           Configuration Item: APT::Get::Diff-Only, APT::Get::Dsc-Only, and\n           APT::Get::Tar-Only.\n\n       --arch-only\n           Only process architecture-dependent build-dependencies.\n           Configuration Item: APT::Get::Arch-Only.\n\n       --allow-unauthenticated\n           Ignore if packages can't be authenticated and don't prompt about\n           it. This is useful for tools like pbuilder. Configuration Item:\n           APT::Get::AllowUnauthenticated.\n\n       -h, --help\n           Show a short usage summary.\n\n       -v, --version\n           Show the program version.\n\n       -c, --config-file\n           Configuration File; Specify a configuration file to use. The\n           program will read the default configuration file and then this\n           configuration file. See apt.conf(5) for syntax information.\n\n       -o, --option\n           Set a Configuration Option; This will set an arbitrary\n           configuration option. The syntax is -o Foo::Bar=bar.  -o and\n           --option can be used multiple times to set different options.\n"

      "<b>       install</b>\n\n           Install one or more packages. The packages should be listed after\n           the “install” command; if a package name contains a tilde character\n           (“<b>~</b>”) or a question mark (“<b>?</b>”), it will be treated as a search\n           pattern and every package matching the pattern will be installed\n           (see the section “Search Patterns” in the <b>aptitude</b> reference\n           manual).\n\n           To select a particular version of the package, append “<b>=&lt;</b><u>version</u>&gt;”\n           to the package name: for instance, “<b>aptitude</b> <b>install</b> <b>apt=0.3.1</b>”.\n           Similarly, to select a package from a particular archive, append\n           “<b>/&lt;</b><u>archive</u>&gt;” to the package name: for instance, “<b>aptitude</b> <b>install</b>\n           <b>apt/experimental</b>”.\n\n           Not every package listed on the command line has to be installed;\n           you can tell <b>aptitude</b> to do something different with a package by\n           appending an “override specifier” to the name of the package. For\n           example, <b>aptitude</b> <b>remove</b> <b>wesnoth+</b> will install <b>wesnoth</b>, not remove\n           it. The following override specifiers are available:\n\n           &lt;<u>package</u>&gt;<b>+</b>\n\n               Install &lt;<u>package</u>&gt;.\n\n           &lt;<u>package</u>&gt;<b>+M</b>\n               Install &lt;<u>package</u>&gt; and immediately mark it as automatically\n               installed (note that if nothing depends on &lt;<u>package</u>&gt;, this will\n               cause it to be immediately removed).\n\n           &lt;<u>package</u>&gt;<b>-</b>\n\n               Remove &lt;<u>package</u>&gt;.\n\n           &lt;<u>package</u>&gt;<b>_</b>\n               Purge &lt;<u>package</u>&gt;: remove it and all its associated configuration\n               and data files.\n\n           &lt;<u>package</u>&gt;<b>=</b>\n               Place &lt;<u>package</u>&gt; on hold: cancel any active installation,\n               upgrade, or removal, and prevent this package from being\n               automatically upgraded in the future.\n\n           &lt;<u>package</u>&gt;<b>:</b>\n\n               Keep &lt;<u>package</u>&gt; at its current version: cancel any installation,\n               removal, or upgrade. Unlike “hold” (above) this does not\n               prevent automatic upgrades in the future.\n\n           &lt;<u>package</u>&gt;<b>&amp;M</b>\n               Mark &lt;<u>package</u>&gt; as having been automatically installed.\n\n           &lt;<u>package</u>&gt;<b>&amp;m</b>\n               Mark &lt;<u>package</u>&gt; as having been manually installed.\n\n           As a special case, “<b>install</b>” with no arguments will act on any\n           stored/pending actions.\n\n               <b>Note</b>\n\n               Once you enter <b>Y</b> at the final confirmation prompt, the\n               “<b>install</b>” command will modify <b>aptitude</b>'s stored information\n               about what actions to perform. Therefore, if you issue (e.g.)\n               the command “<b>aptitude</b> <b>install</b> <b>foo</b> <b>bar</b>” and then exit the\n               installation once <b>aptitude</b> has started downloading and\n               installing packages, you will need to run “<b>aptitude</b> <b>remove</b> <b>foo</b>\n\n               <b>bar</b>” to cancel that order.\n\n       <b>remove</b>, <b>purge</b>, <b>hold</b>, <b>unhold</b>, <b>keep</b>, <b>reinstall</b>\n           These commands are the same as “<b>install</b>”, but apply the named\n           action to all packages given on the command line for which it is\n           not overridden. The difference between <b>hold</b> and <b>keep</b> is that <b>hold</b>\n\n           will cause a package to be ignored by future <b>safe-upgrade</b> or\n           <b>full-upgrade</b> commands, while <b>keep</b> merely cancels any scheduled\n           actions on the package.  <b>unhold</b> will allow a package to be upgraded\n           by future <b>safe-upgrade</b> or <b>full-upgrade</b> commands, without otherwise\n           altering its state.\n\n           For instance, “<b>aptitude</b> <b>remove</b> <b>'~ndeity'</b>” will remove all packages\n           whose name contains “<b>deity</b>”.\n\n       <b>markauto</b>, <b>unmarkauto</b>\n\n           Mark packages as automatically installed or manually installed,\n           respectively. Packages are specified in exactly the same way as for\n           the “<b>install</b>” command. For instance, “<b>aptitude</b> <b>markauto</b> <b>'~slibs'</b>”\n           will mark all packages in the “<b>libs</b>” section as having been\n           automatically installed.\n\n           For more information on automatically installed packages, see the\n           section “Managing Automatically Installed Packages” in the <b>aptitude</b>\n           reference manual.\n\n       <b>build-depends</b>, <b>build-dep</b>\n\n           Satisfy the build-dependencies of a package. Each package name may\n           be a source package, in which case the build dependencies of that\n           source package are installed; otherwise, binary packages are found\n           in the same way as for the “<b>install</b>” command, and the\n           build-dependencies of the source packages that build those binary\n           packages are satisfied.\n\n           If the command-line parameter <b>--arch-only</b> is present, only\n           architecture-dependent build dependencies (i.e., not\n           <b>Build-Depends-Indep</b> or <b>Build-Conflicts-Indep</b>) will be obeyed.\n\n       <b>forbid-version</b>\n           Forbid a package from being upgraded to a particular version. This\n           will prevent aptitude from automatically upgrading to this version,\n           but will allow automatic upgrades to future versions. By default,\n           aptitude will select the version to which the package would\n           normally be upgraded; you can override this selection by appending\n           “<b>=&lt;</b><u>version</u>&gt;” to the package name: for instance, “<b>aptitude</b>\n\n           <b>forbid-version</b> <b>vim=1.2.3.broken-4</b>”.\n\n           This command is useful for avoiding broken versions of packages\n           without having to set and clear manual holds. If you decide you\n           really want the forbidden version after all, the “<b>install</b>” command\n           will remove the ban.\n\n       <b>update</b>\n           Updates the list of available packages from the apt sources (this\n           is equivalent to “<b>apt-get</b> <b>update</b>”)\n\n       <b>safe-upgrade</b>\n\n           Upgrades installed packages to their most recent version. Installed\n           packages will not be removed unless they are unused (see the\n           section “Managing Automatically Installed Packages” in the <b>aptitude</b>\n           reference manual). Packages which are not currently installed may\n           be installed to resolve dependencies unless the <b>--no-new-installs</b>\n           command-line option is supplied.\n\n           It is sometimes necessary to remove one package in order to upgrade\n           another; this command is not able to upgrade packages in such\n           situations. Use the <b>full-upgrade</b> command to upgrade as many\n           packages as possible.\n\n       <b>full-upgrade</b>\n           Upgrades installed packages to their most recent version, removing\n           or installing packages as necessary. This command is less\n           conservative than <b>safe-upgrade</b> and thus more likely to perform\n           unwanted actions. However, it is capable of upgrading packages that\n           <b>safe-upgrade</b> cannot upgrade.\n\n               <b>Note</b>\n\n               This command was originally named <b>dist-upgrade</b> for historical\n               reasons, and <b>aptitude</b> still recognizes <b>dist-upgrade</b> as a\n               synonym for <b>full-upgrade</b>.\n\n       <b>keep-all</b>\n           Cancels all scheduled actions on all packages; any packages whose\n           sticky state indicates an installation, removal, or upgrade will\n           have this sticky state cleared.\n\n       <b>forget-new</b>\n\n           Forgets all internal information about what packages are “new”\n           (equivalent to pressing “f” when in visual mode).\n\n       <b>search</b>\n           Searches for packages matching one of the patterns supplied on the\n           command line. All packages which match any of the given patterns\n           will be displayed; for instance, “<b>aptitude</b> <b>search</b> <b>'~N'</b> <b>edit</b>” will\n           list all “new” packages and all packages whose name contains\n           “edit”. For more information on search patterns, see the section\n           “Search Patterns” in the <b>aptitude</b> reference manual.\n\n           Unless you pass the <b>-F</b> option, the output of <b>aptitude</b> <b>search</b> will\n           look something like this:\n\n               i   apt                             - Advanced front-end for dpkg\n               pi  apt-build                       - frontend to apt to build, optimize and in\n               cp  apt-file                        - APT package searching utility -- command-\n               ihA raptor-utils                    - Raptor RDF Parser utilities\n\n           Each search result is listed on a separate line. The first\n           character of each line indicates the current state of the package:\n           the most common states are <b>p</b>, meaning that no trace of the package\n           exists on the system, <b>c</b>, meaning that the package was deleted but\n           its configuration files remain on the system, <b>i</b>, meaning that the\n           package is installed, and <b>v</b>, meaning that the package is virtual.\n           The second character indicates the stored action (if any; otherwise\n           a blank space is displayed) to be performed on the package, with\n           the most common actions being <b>i</b>, meaning that the package will be\n           installed, <b>d</b>, meaning that the package will be deleted, and <b>p</b>,\n           meaning that the package and its configuration files will be\n           removed. If the third character is <b>A</b>, the package was automatically\n           installed.\n\n           For a complete list of the possible state and action flags, see the\n           section “Accessing Package Information” in the <b>aptitude</b> reference\n           guide. To customize the output of <b>search</b>, see the command-line\n           options <b>-F</b> and <b>--sort</b>.\n\n       <b>show</b>\n\n           Displays detailed information about one or more packages, listed\n           following the search command. If a package name contains a tilde\n           character (“<b>~</b>”) or a question mark (“<b>?</b>”), it will be treated as a\n           search pattern and all matching packages will be displayed (see the\n           section “Search Patterns” in the <b>aptitude</b> reference manual).\n\n           If the verbosity level is 1 or greater (i.e., at least one <b>-v</b> is\n           present on the command-line), information about all versions of the\n           package is displayed. Otherwise, information about the “candidate\n           version” (the version that “<b>aptitude</b> <b>install</b>” would download) is\n           displayed.\n\n           You can display information about a different version of the\n           package by appending <b>=&lt;</b><u>version</u>&gt; to the package name; you can\n           display the version from a particular archive by appending\n           <b>/&lt;</b><u>archive</u>&gt; to the package name. If either of these is present, then\n           only the version you request will be displayed, regardless of the\n           verbosity level.\n\n           If the verbosity level is 1 or greater, the package's architecture,\n           compressed size, filename, and md5sum fields will be displayed. If\n           the verbosity level is 2 or greater, the select version or versions\n           will be displayed once for each archive in which they are found.\n\n       <b>add-user-tag</b>, <b>remove-user-tag</b>\n\n           Adds a user tag to or removes a user tag from the selected group of\n           packages. If a package name contains a tilde (“<b>~</b>”) or question mark\n           (“<b>?</b>”), it is treated as a search pattern and the tag is added to or\n           removed from all the packages that match the pattern (see the\n           section “Search Patterns” in the <b>aptitude</b> reference manual).\n\n           User tags are arbitrary strings associated with a package. They can\n           be used with the <b>?user-tag(&lt;</b><u>tag</u>&gt;<b>)</b> search term, which will select\n           all the packages that have a user tag matching &lt;<u>tag</u>&gt;.\n\n       <b>why</b>, <b>why-not</b>\n\n           Explains the reason that a particular package should or cannot be\n           installed on the system.\n\n           This command searches for packages that require or conflict with\n           the given package. It displays a sequence of dependencies leading\n           to the target package, along with a note indicating the installed\n           state of each package in the dependency chain:\n\n               $ aptitude why kdepim\n               i   nautilus-data Recommends nautilus\n               i A nautilus      Recommends desktop-base (&gt;= 0.2)\n               i A desktop-base  Suggests   gnome | kde | xfce4 | wmaker\n               p   kde           Depends    kdepim (&gt;= 4:3.4.3)\n\n           The command <b>why</b> finds a dependency chain that installs the package\n           named on the command line, as above. Note that the dependency that\n           aptitude produced in this case is only a suggestion. This is\n           because no package currently installed on this computer depends on\n           or recommends the kdepim package; if a stronger dependency were\n           available, aptitude would have displayed it.\n\n           In contrast, <b>why-not</b> finds a dependency chain leading to a conflict\n           with the target package:\n\n               $ aptitude why-not textopo\n               i   ocaml-core          Depends   ocamlweb\n               i A ocamlweb            Depends   tetex-extra | texlive-latex-extra\n               i A texlive-latex-extra Conflicts textopo\n\n           If one or more &lt;<u>pattern</u>&gt;s are present, then aptitude will begin its\n           search at these patterns; that is, the first package in the chain\n           it prints will be a package matching the pattern in question. The\n           patterns are considered to be package names unless they contain a\n           tilde character (“<b>~</b>”) or a question mark (“<b>?</b>”), in which case they\n           are treated as search patterns (see the section “Search Patterns”\n           in the <b>aptitude</b> reference manual).\n\n           If no patterns are present, then <b>aptitude</b> will search for\n           dependency chains beginning at manually installed packages. This\n           effectively shows the packages that have caused or would cause a\n           given package to be installed.\n\n               <b>Note</b>\n\n               <b>aptitude</b> <b>why</b> does not perform full dependency resolution; it\n               only displays direct relationships between packages. For\n               instance, if A requires B, C requires D, and B and C conflict,\n               “<b>aptitude</b> <b>why-not</b> <b>D</b>” will not produce the answer “A depends on\n               B, B conflicts with C, and D depends on C”.\n           By default aptitude outputs only the “most installed, strongest,\n           tightest, shortest” dependency chain. That is, it looks for a chain\n           that only contains packages which are installed or will be\n           installed; it looks for the strongest possible dependencies under\n           that restriction; it looks for chains that avoid ORed dependencies\n           and Provides; and it looks for the shortest dependency chain\n           meeting those criteria. These rules are progressively weakened\n           until a match is found.\n\n           If the verbosity level is 1 or more, then <u>all</u> the explanations\n           aptitude can find will be displayed, in inverse order of relevance.\n           If the verbosity level is 2 or more, a truly excessive amount of\n           debugging information will be printed to standard output.\n\n           This command returns 0 if successful, 1 if no explanation could be\n           constructed, and -1 if an error occured.\n\n       <b>clean</b>\n\n           Removes all previously downloaded <b>.deb</b> files from the package cache\n           directory (usually /var/cache/apt/archives).\n\n       <b>autoclean</b>\n           Removes any cached packages which can no longer be downloaded. This\n           allows you to prevent a cache from growing out of control over time\n           without completely emptying it.\n\n       <b>changelog</b>\n           Downloads and displays the Debian changelog for each of the given\n           source or binary packages.\n\n           By default, the changelog for the version which would be installed\n           with “<b>aptitude</b> <b>install</b>” is downloaded. You can select a particular\n           version of a package by appending <b>=&lt;</b><u>version</u>&gt; to the package name;\n           you can select the version from a particular archive by appending\n           <b>/&lt;</b><u>archive</u>&gt; to the package name.\n\n       <b>download</b>\n\n           Downloads the <b>.deb</b> file for the given package to the current\n           directory. If a package name contains a tilde character (“<b>~</b>”) or a\n           question mark (“<b>?</b>”), it will be treated as a search pattern and all\n           the matching packages will be downloaded (see the section “Search\n           Patterns” in the <b>aptitude</b> reference manual).\n\n           By default, the version which would be installed with “<b>aptitude</b>\n           <b>install</b>” is downloaded. You can select a particular version of a\n           package by appending <b>=&lt;</b><u>version</u>&gt; to the package name; you can select\n           the version from a particular archive by appending <b>/&lt;</b><u>archive</u>&gt; to\n           the package name.\n\n       <b>extract-cache-subset</b>\n\n           Copy the apt configuration directory (<b>/etc/apt</b>) and a subset of the\n           package database to the specified directory.

Any existing package database files\n           in the output directory will be overwritten.\n\n           Dependencies in binary package stanzas will be rewritten to remove\n           references to packages not in the selected set.\n\n       <b>help</b>\n           Displays a brief summary of the available commands and options.",

In particular: normally <b>aptitude</b> will add\n           whitespace or truncate search results in an attempt to fit its\n           results into vertical “columns”. With this flag, each line will be\n           formed by replacing any format escapes in the format string with\n           the correponding text; column widths will be ignored.\n\n           For instance, the first few lines of output from “<b>aptitude</b> <b>search</b>\n\n           <b>-F</b> <b>'%p</b> <b>%V'</b> <b>--disable-columns</b> <b>libedataserver</b>” might be:\n\n               disksearch 1.2.1-3\n               hp-search-mac 0.1.3\n               libbsearch-ruby 1.5-5\n               libbsearch-ruby1.8 1.5-5\n               libclass-dbi-abstractsearch-perl 0.07-2\n               libdbix-fulltextsearch-perl 0.73-10\n\n           As in the above example, <b>--disable-columns</b> is often useful in\n           combination with a custom display format set using the command-line\n           option <b>-F</b>.\n\n           This corresponds to the configuration option\n           <b>Aptitude::CmdLine::Disable-Columns</b>.\n\n       <b>-D</b>, <b>--show-deps</b>\n\n           For commands that will install or remove packages (<b>install</b>,\n           <b>full-upgrade</b>, etc), show brief explanations of automatic\n           installations and removals.\n\n           This corresponds to the configuration option\n           <b>Aptitude::CmdLine::Show-Deps</b>.\n\n       <b>-d</b>, <b>--download-only</b>\n           Download packages to the package cache as necessary, but do not\n           install or remove anything.

The pattern\n           is a search pattern as described in the section “Search Patterns”\n           in the <b>aptitude</b> reference manual.\n\n           For instance, <b>aptitude</b> <b>safe-upgrade</b> <b>--remove-user-tag-from</b>\n\n           <b>\"not-upgraded,?action(upgrade)\"</b> will remove the <b>not-upgraded</b> tag\n           from all packages that the <b>safe-upgrade</b> command is able to upgrade.\n\n       <b>-s</b>, <b>--simulate</b>\n           In command-line mode, print the actions that would normally be\n           performed, but don't actually perform them.

In the visual interface, always open the cache in\n           read-only mode regardless of whether you are root.\n\n           This corresponds to the configuration option <b>Aptitude::Simulate</b>.\n\n       <b>--safe-resolver</b>\n\n           When package dependency problems are encountered, use a “safe”\n           algorithm to solve them.

In this example, libdb4.2-dev conflicts with\n           libdb-dev, which is provided by libdb-dev.\n\n           This argument corresponds to the configuration option\n           <b>Aptitude::CmdLine::Show-Why</b> and displays the same information that\n           is computed by <b>aptitude</b> <b>why</b> and <b>aptitude</b> <b>why-not</b>.\n\n       <b>-w</b> &lt;<u>width</u>&gt;, <b>--width</b> &lt;<u>width</u>&gt;\n\n           Specify the display width which should be used for output from the\n           <b>search</b> command (by default, the terminal width is used).\n\n           This corresponds to the configuration option\n           <b>Aptitude::CmdLine::Package-Display-Width</b>\n\n       <b>-y</b>, <b>--assume-yes</b>\n           When a yes/no prompt would be presented, assume that the user\n           entered “yes”.

This flag overrides that mechanism, and forces bzip2 to decompress.\n\n   -z --compress    The complement to -d: forces compression, regardless of the invokation name.\n\n   -t --test        Check integrity of the specified file(s), but don't decompress them.\n                    This really performs a trial decompression and throws away the result.\n\n   -f --force       Force overwrite of output files. Normally, bzip2 will not overwrite existing\n                    output files. Also forces bzip2 to break hard links to files, which it otherwise\n                    wouldn't do. bzip2 normally declines to decompress files which don't have the\n                    correct magic header bytes. If forced (-f), however, it will pass such files\n                    through unmodified. This is how GNU gzip behaves.\n\n   -k --keep        Keep (don't delete) input files during compression or decompression.\n\n   -s --small       Reduce memory usage, for compression, decompression and testing. Files are\n                    decompressed and tested using a modified algorithm which only requires 2.5 bytes\n                    per block byte. This means any file can be decompressed in 2300k of memory, albeit\n                    at about half the normal speed. During compression, -s selects a block size of\n                    200k, which limits memory use to around the same figure, at the expense of your\n                    compression ratio. In short, if your machine is low on memory (8 megabytes or less),\n                    use -s for everything.\n\n   -q --quiet       Suppress non-essential warning messages. Messages pertaining to I/O errors and\n                    other critical events will not be suppressed.\n\n   -v --verbose     Verbose mode -- show the compression ratio for each file processed. Further -v's\n                    increase the verbosity level, spewing out lots of information which is primarily\n                    of interest for diagnostic purposes.\n\n   -L --license\n   -V --version     Display the software version, license terms and conditions.\n\n   -1 (or --fast) to -9 (or -best)\n                    Set the block size to 100 k, 200 k ... 900 k when compressing. Has no effect when\n                    decompressing. The --fast and --best aliases are primarily for GNU gzip\n                    compatibility. In particular, --fast doesn't make things significantly faster.\n                    And --best merely selects the default behaviour.\n\n   --               Treats all subsequent arguments as file names, even if they start with a dash.\n                    This is so you can handle files with names beginning with a dash,\n                    for example: bzip2 -- -myfilename.\n\n   --repetitive-fast, --repetitive-best\n                    These flags are redundant in versions 0.9.5 and above. They provided some coarse\n                    control over the behaviour of the sorting algorithm in earlier versions, bzip now\n                    has an improved algorithm which renders these flags irrelevant."

Read a list of filenames, one per line, from standard input and produce a new archive on standard output\n            (unless overriden) containing the specified items.\n\n      -p    <b>Pass-Thru</b> mode.  Read a list of filenames from standard input and copy the files to the specified directory.\n            This combines the copy-out and copy-in steps without actually using an archive.\nOptions:\n\n   Unless specifically stated otherwise, options are applicable in all operating modes.\n\n   -0, --null\n       Read filenames separated by NUL characters instead of newlines. (copy-out and pass-thru modes.)\n       This is necessary if any of the filenames being read might contain newlines.\n       GNU find is one way to produce a list of null-terminated filenames.\n\n   -a, --reset-access-time\n       Reset the access times of files after reading them, so that it does not look like they have just been read.\n       (copy-out and pass-thru modes.)\n\n   -A, --append\n       Append to an existing archive.

Equivalent to -sS.\n       (may be used in copy-in mode.)\n       Use this option to convert 32-bit integers between big-endian and little-endian machines. \n\n   -B\n       Set the I/O block size to 5120 bytes. Initially the block size is 512 bytes. (copy-out mode only)\n\n   --block-size=<i>BLOCK-SIZE</i>\n       Set the I/O block size to BLOCK-SIZE * 512 bytes.\n\n   -c  Identical to '-H newc', use the new (SVR4 ) portable format. (copy-out mode only)\n       If you wish the old portable (ASCII ) archive format, use '-H odc' instead.\n\n   -C <i>IO-SIZE</i>, --io-size=<i>IO-SIZE</i>\n       Set the I/O block size to IO-SIZE bytes. (copy-out mode only.)\n\n   -d, --make-directories\n       Create leading directories where needed. (copy-in and pass-thru modes.)\n\n   -E <i>FILE</i>, --pattern-file=<i>FILE</i>\n       Read additional patterns specifying filenames to extract or list from <i>FILE</i>. (copy-in mode only.)\n       The lines of <i>FILE </i>are treated as if they had been non-option arguments to cpio. This option is used in copy-in mode, \n\n   -f, --nonmatching\n       Only copy files that do not match any of the given patterns. \n\n   -F, --file=<i>archive</i>\n       Archive filename to use instead of standard input or output. (copy-in mode only.)\n       To use a tape drive on another machine as the archive, use a filename that starts with 'HOSTNAME: '.\n       The hostname can be preceded by a username and an '@' to access the remote tape drive as that user, if you have\n       permission to do so (typically an entry in that user's '~/.rhosts' file). \n\n   --force-local\n       With -F, -I, or -O, take the archive file name to be a local file even if it contains a colon, which would\n       ordinarily indicate a remote host name.\n\n   -H <i>FORMAT</i>, --format=<i>FORMAT</i>\n       Use archive format <i>FORMAT</i>. The valid formats are listed below; the same names are also recognized in all-caps.\n       The default in copy-in mode is to automatically detect the archive format, and in copy-out mode is 'bin'.\n\n          'bin'    The obsolete binary format. \n          'odc'    The old (POSIX .1) portable format. \n          'newc'   The new (SVR4 ) portable format, which supports file systems having more than 65536 i-nodes. \n          'crc'    The new (SVR4 ) portable format with a checksum added. \n          'tar'    The old tar format. \n          'ustar'  The POSIX .1 tar format. Also recognizes GNU tar archives, which are similar but not identical. \n          'hpbin'  The obsolete binary format used by HPUX 's cpio (which stores device files differently). \n          'hpodc'  The portable format used by HPUX 's cpio (which stores device files differently). \n\n   -i, --extract\n       Run in copy-in mode. see 'Copy-in mode'. \n\n   -I archive\n       Archive filename to use instead of standard input.\n       To use a tape drive on another machine as the archive, use a filename that starts with 'HOSTNAME: '.\n       The hostname can be preceded by a username and an '@' to access the remote tape drive as that user, if you\n       have permission to do so (typically an entry in that user's '~/.rhosts' file). \n\n   -k\n       Ignored; for compatibility with other versions of cpio.\n\n   -l, --link\n       Link files instead of copying them, when possible.  (pass-thru mode only.)\n\n   -L, --dereference\n       Copy the file that a symbolic link points to, rather than the symbolic link itself.  (copy-out and pass-thru modes.)\n\n   -m, --preserve-modification-time\n       Retain previous file modification times when creating files. (copy-in and pass-thru modes.)\n\n   -M <i>MESSAGE</i>, --message=<i>MESSAGE</i>\n       Print <i>MESSAGE</i> when the end of a volume of the backup media (such as a tape or a floppy disk) is reached, to\n       prompt the user to insert a new volume. (copy-in and copy-out modes.)\n       If MESSAGE contains the string '%d', it is replaced by the current volume number (starting at 1). \n\n   -n, --numeric-uid-gid\n       Show numeric UID and GID instead of translating them into names when using the '--verbose option'.\n       (i mode, only with -t)\n\n   --no-absolute-filenames\n       Create all files relative to the current directory in copy-in mode, even if they have an absolute file name in the archive.\n\n   --absolute-filenames' (default)\n       Do not strip leading file name components that contain '..' and leading slashes from file names in copy-in mode \n\n   --no-preserve-owner\n       Do not change the ownership of the files; leave them owned by the user extracting them.\n       This is the default for non-root users, so that users on System V don't inadvertently give away files.\n       (This option can be used in copy-in mode and copy-pass mode.)\n\n   -o, --create\n       Run in copy-out mode. see 'Copy-out mode'. \n\n   -O archive\n       Archive filename to use instead of standard output. (Copy-out mode only)\n       To use a tape drive on another machine as the archive, use a filename that starts with 'HOSTNAME: '.\n       The hostname can be preceded by a username and an '@' to access the remote tape drive as that user, if you\n       have permission to do so (typically an entry in that user's '~/.rhosts' file). \n\n   --only-verify-crc\n       Verify the CRC 's of each file in the archive, when reading a CRC format archive.\n       Don't actually extract the files. \n\n   -p, --pass-through\n       Run in copy-pass mode. see 'Copy-pass mode'. \n\n   --quiet\n       Do not print the number of blocks copied.\n\n   -r, --rename\n       Interactively rename files. \n\n   -R [<i>user</i>][:.][<i>group</i>], --owner [<i>user</i>][:.][<i>group</i>]\n       Set the ownership of all files created to the specified user and/or group in copy-out and copy-pass modes.\n       Either the user, the group, or both, must be present. If the group is omitted but the ':' or '.' separator is\n       given, use the given user's login group. Only the super-user can change files' ownership. \n\n   --rsh-command=<i>COMMAND</i>\n       Notifies cpio that is should use COMMAND to communicate with remote devices. \n\n   -s, --swap-bytes\n       Swap the bytes of each halfword (pair of bytes) in the files. (copy-in mode.)\n\n   -S, --swap-halfwords\n       Swap the halfwords of each word (4 bytes) in the files. (copy-in mode.)\n\n   --sparse\n       Write files with large blocks of zeros as sparse files. (copy-in and copy-pass modes.)\n\n   -t, --list\n       Print a table of contents of the input.

It is supposedly the data\n        previously received from the server in a \"Set-Cookie:\" line.\n        The data should be in the format  \"NAME1=VALUE1; NAME2=VALUE2\".\n\n   -c <i>filename</i>\n   --cookie-jar <i>file name</i>\n        Save cookies to <i>file</i> after a completed operation.\n        Curl writes all cookies previously read from a specified file\n        as well as all cookies received from remote server(s).\n        If no cookies are known, no file will be written.\n        TO write to stdout, set the file name to a single dash,  \"-\"\n\n   --compressed\n          Request a compressed response using one of the algorithms\n        curl supports (gzip), and save  the  uncompressed  document.\n        If this option  is  used  and  the server sends an unsupported encoding,\n        curl will report an error.(HTTP)\n\n   -d @<i>file</i>\n   -d \"<i>string</i>\"\n   --data \"<i>string</i>\"\n        Send the specified data in an (HTTP) POST request, in the same way that a\n        web browser does.\n        This  will pass the data using the content-type\n        application/x-www-form-urlencoded.  Compare to -F, --form.\n\n        -d, --data is the same as  --data-ascii.  To post data in pure binary, use --data-binary.\n        To URL-encode the value of a form field you may use --data-urlencode.\n\n        Multiple date options will be merged together.\n        Thus,  using  '-d  name=daniel  -d skill=lousy' would generate a post\n        that looks like  'name=daniel&amp;skill=lousy'.\n\n        If the data starts with @, the rest should be a filename containing the data.\n   \n   -F <i>name</i>=@<i>file</i>\n   -F <i>name</i>=<i>content</i>\n     --form <i>name</i>=<i>content</i>\n        Emulate a filled-in form in which a user has pressed the submit button.\n        This will POST data using the Content-Type  multipart/form-data according\n        to  RFC 2388.  This enables uploading of binary files etc.\n\n        If the data starts with @, the rest should be a filename.\n        To just get the content part from a file, prefix the file name with the\n        symbol &lt;. The difference between @ and &lt;  is that  @  makes a file get\n        attached in the post as a file upload, while the &lt; makes a text field\n        and gets the contents for that text field from a file.\n\n        Example, to send your password file to the server, where 'password' is\n        the name of the form-field to which /etc/passwd will be the input:\n\n        curl -F password=@/etc/passwd www.mypasswords.com\n\n   -k\n   --insecure\n        This option explicitly allows curl to  perform  \"insecure\" SSL connections\n        and transfers. All SSL connections are attempted in secure mode using the\n        CA certificate  bundle  installed by  default. This  makes  all connections\n        considered \"insecure\" fail unless -k, --insecure is used.(SSL)\n\n   --limit-rate <i>speed</i>\n        Specify the maximum transfer rate.  This feature is useful if you have a\n        limited pipe and you'd like your transfer not to use your entire bandwidth.\n\n        The given speed is measured in bytes/second, unless a suffix  is appended.\n        Appending 'k' or 'K' will count the number as kilobytes/sec, 'm' or M' megabytes,\n        while 'g' or 'G' makes it gigabytes/sec. Eg: 200K, 3m, 1G.\n\n   -m <i>seconds</i>\n   --max-time <i>seconds</i>\n        Maximum time that you allow the whole operation to take.\n        This is useful for preventing your batch jobs from  hanging for hours due to\n        slow networks or links going down.  See also the --connect-timeout option.\n\n   -o <i>file</i>\n   --output <i>file</i>\n        Write output to <i>file</i> instead of stdout. If you are using {} or [] to fetch\n        multiple documents, you can use '#' followed by a number  in  the <i>file</i> specifier.\n        That variable will be replaced with the current string for the URL being fetched.\n        Like in:\n                 curl https://{one,two}.site.com -o \"file_#1.txt\"\n        or use several variables like:\n                 curl https://{site,host}.host[1-5].com -o \"#1_#2\"\n        You may use this option as many times as the number of URLs you have.\n\n        See also --create-dirs option to create the local directories dynamically.\n        Specify '-' to force the output to stdout.   \n\n   -O\n   --remote-name\n        Write output to a local file named like the remote file we get.\n        (Only the file part of the remote file is used, the path is cut off.)\n        The  remote file name to use for saving is extracted from the given URL, nothing else.\n        Consequentially, the file will be saved in the  current  working directory.\n\n   -s\n   --silent\n        Silent or quiet mode. Don't show progress meter or error messages.\n   \n   --trace-ascii <i>file</i>\n        Enable a full trace dump of all  incoming  and  outgoing  data, including\n        descriptive information, to the given output file.\n        Use \"-\" as filename to have the output sent to stdout.\n        This option overrides previous uses of -v, --verbose or --trace-ascii.\n        If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.\n\n   -T <i>file</i>\n     --upload-file <i>file</i>\n        Transfer the specified local file to the remote  URL.  PUT\n        If there is no file part in the specified URL, Curl will append the local\n        file name. You must use a trailing / on the last directory to really prove\n        to Curl that there is no file name or curl will think that the last\n        directory name is the remote file name to use.\n        Use the file name \"-\" to use stdin\n\n        You can specify one -T for each URL on the command line. Each -T\n        + URL pair specifies what to upload and to where. curl also supports \"globbing\"\n        of the -T argument, meaning that you can upload multiple files to a single URL\n        like this:\n\n        curl -T \"{file1,file2}\" https://www.uploadtothissite.com\n        or even\n        curl -T \"img[1-1000].png\" ftp://ftp.picturemania.com/upload/\n\n   -I\n   --head\n        Fetch the HTTP-header only! (HTTP/FTP/FILE) \n        HTTP-servers feature the  command  HEAD which this uses to get nothing but\n        the header of a document. When used on an FTP or <i>FILE</i> file, curl displays\n        the file size and last modification time only.\n\n   -u <i>user</i>:<i>password</i>\n   --user <i>user</i>:<i>password</i>\n        The username and password to use for server authentication.\n        Overrides -n, --netrc and --netrc-optional.\n\n        If you just give the user name (without entering a  colon) curl will prompt\n        for a password.\n\n        If you use an SSPI-enabled curl binary and do NTLM authentication, you can\n        force curl to pick up the username and password from your environment by\n        specifying a single colon with this option: \"-u :\".\n\n        If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.\n\n   -w\n   --write-out <i>format</i>\n        Define extra info to display on stdout after a completed and successful operation.\n        The <i>format</i> is a string that may contain plain text mixed with any\n        number of variables. The <i>format</i> string can be specified  as \"<i>string</i>\", or to\n        read from a file specify  \"@filename\" \n        to read the format from stdin use \"@-\".\n\n        Various variables may be included in the format and will be substituted by\n        curl (file size, ip address etc see man curl for details).\n        variables are specified as %{<i>variable_name</i>} \n\n        Output a newline using \\n, a carriage return with \\r and a tab space with \\t.\n\n   -x <i>host</i>:<i>port</i>\n   -x  [<i>protocol</i>://][<i>user</i>:<i>password</i>@]<i>proxyhost</i>[:<i>port</i>]\n   --proxy [<i>protocol</i>://][<i>user</i>:<i>password</i>@]<i>proxyhost</i>[:<i>port</i>]\n        Use the  specified HTTP proxy.\n        If the port number is not specified, it is assumed at port 1080.\n\n\n   -H \"<i>name</i>: <i>value</i>\"\n   --header \"<i>name</i>: <i>value</i>\"\n        Add Header when getting a web page.\n        You may specify any number of extra headers.\n\n   -H \"<i>name</i>:\"\n   --header \"<i>name</i>:\"\n        Remove Header, remove an internal header.\n\n   -L\n   --location\n        Follow redirects if the server reports that the requested page has moved\n        (indicated with a Location: header and a 3XX response code)\n\n   -v\n   --verbose\n        Make more verbose/talkative.

(SI\n     is the International System of Units, which defines these letters\n     as prefixes.)  Powers of 1000 are used, not 1024; 'M' stands for\n     1,000,000 bytes.  Use the '-h' or '--human-readable' option if you\n     prefer powers of 1024.\n\n -i\n --inodes\n     List inode usage information instead of block usage.  An inode\n     (short for index node) is contains information about a file such\n     as its owner, permissions, timestamps, and location on the disk.\n\n -k\n --kilobytes\n     Print sizes in 1024-byte blocks, overriding the default block size.\n\n -l\n --local\n     Limit the listing to local filesystems.

This is the default.\n\n -P\n --portability\n     Use the POSIX output format.  This is like the default format\n     except that the information about each filesystem is always\n     printed on exactly one line; a mount device is never put on a line\n     by itself.  This means that if the mount device name is more than\n     20 characters long (e.g., for some network mounts), the columns\n     are misaligned.\n\n --sync\n     Invoke the 'sync' system call before getting any usage data.  On\n     some systems (notably SunOS), doing this yields more up to date\n     results, but in general this option makes 'df' much slower,\n     especially when there are many or very busy filesystems.\n\n -t <i>FSTYPE</i>\n --type=<i>FSTYPE</i>\n     Limit the listing to filesystems of type FSTYPE.  Multiple\n     filesystem types can be specified by giving multiple '-t' options.\n     By default, nothing is omitted.\n\n -T\n --print-type\n     Print each filesystem's type.

Here are\n     some of the common names (this list is certainly not exhaustive):\n\n    'nfs'\n          An NFS filesystem, i.e., one mounted over a network from\n          another machine.  This is the one type name which seems to be\n          used uniformly by all systems.\n\n    '4.2, ufs, efs...'\n          A filesystem on a locally-mounted hard disk.  (The system\n          might even support more than one type here; Linux does.)\n\n    'hsfs, cdfs'\n          A filesystem on a CD-ROM drive.  HP-UX uses 'cdfs', most other\n          systems use 'hsfs' ('hs' for 'High Sierra').\n\n    'pcfs'\n          An MS-DOS filesystem, usually on a diskette.\n\n -x <i>FSTYPE</i>\n --exclude-type=<i>FSTYPE</i>\n     Limit the listing to filesystems not of type <i>FSTYPE</i>.

Either namefile or at least one filename argument\n                   must be present; to test the standard input, use '-' as a filename argument.\n   -h, --no-dereference\n                   option causes symlinks not to be followed (on systems that support symbolic links).\n                   This is the default if the environment variable POSIXLY_CORRECT is not defined.\n   -i, --mime      Causes the file command to output mime type strings rather than the more\n                   traditional human readable ones. Thus it might say 'text/plain; charset=us-ascii'\n                   rather than 'ASCII text'. In order for this option to work, file\n                   changes the way it handles files recognized by the command itself\n                   (such as many of the text file types, directories etc), and makes\n                   use of an alternative 'magic' file. (See the FILES section, below).\n   --mime-type, --mime-encoding\n                   Like -i, but print only the specified element(s).\n   -k, --keep-going\n                   Don't stop at the first match, keep going.

(If you want a newline, see -r)\n   -L, --dereference\n                   option causes symlinks to be followed, as the like-named option\n                   in <a href=\"ls.html\">ls</a>(1) (on systems that support symbolic links).\n                   This is the default if the environment variable POSIXLY_CORRECT is defined.\n   -m, --magic-file magicfiles\n                   Specify an alternate list of files and directories containing magic.\n                   This can be a single item, or a colon-separated list.\n                   If a compiled magic file is found alongside a file or directory, it will be used instead.\n   -N, --no-pad    Don't pad filenames so that they align in the output.\n   -n, --no-buffer Force stdout to be flushed after checking each file. This is only\n                   useful if checking a list of files. It is intended to be used by\n                   programs that want filetype output from a pipe.\n   -p, --preserve-date\n                   On systems that support utime(2) or utimes(2), attempt to preserve\n                   the access time of files analyzed, to pretend that file never read them.\n   -r, --raw       Don't translate unprintable characters to \\ooo. Normally file\n                   translates unprintable characters to their octal representation.\n   -s, --special-files\n                   Normally, file only attempts to read and determine the type of argument\n                   files which stat(2) reports are ordinary files. This prevents problems,\n                   because reading special files can have peculiar consequences.\n                   Specifying the -s option causes file to also read argument files which\n                   are block or character special files. This is useful for determining\n                   the filesystem types of the data in raw disk partitions, which are\n                   block special files. This option also causes file to disregard the\n                   file size as reported by stat(2) since on some systems it reports a\n                   zero size for raw disk partitions.\n   -v, --version   Print the version of the program and exit.\n   -z, --uncompress\n                   Try to look inside compressed files.\n   -0, --print0    Output a null character '\\0' after the end of the filename.\n                   Nice to <a href=\"cut.html\">cut</a>(1) the output.

By default, <i>TYPE</i> is binary, and grep normally outputs\n       either a one-line message saying that a binary file matches, or no message if there\n       is no match. If <i>TYPE</i> is without-match, grep assumes that a binary file does not match;\n       this is equivalent to the -I option. If <i>TYPE</i> is text, grep processes a binary file as\n       if it were text; this is equivalent to the -a option.\n       Warning: grep --binary-files=text might output binary garbage, which can have nasty\n       side effects if the output is a terminal and if the terminal driver interprets some\n       of it as commands. \n   --colour[=<i>WHEN</i>]\n   --color[=<i>WHEN</i>]\n       Surround the matching string with the marker from the GREP_COLOR environment variable.\n       WHEN can be 'never', 'always', or 'auto' e.g. --color=always<br>       By default the matched text will be colored red.\n       If grep is made to match several strings, all of the matches will be colored, one exception\n       is the regex ^ (match beginning of every line), the beginning of a line has no length so will\n       not be coloued.\n       So to return all lines and colour only matches: egrep --color=always '^|string1|string2'\n\n   -C <i>NUM</i>\n   --context=<i>NUM</i>\n       Print NUM lines of output context.\n       Places a line containing -- between contiguous groups of matches. \n   -c\n   --count\n       Suppress normal output; instead print a count of matching lines for each input file.\n       With the -v, --invert-match option (see below), count non-matching lines.\n\n   -D <i>ACTION</i>\n   --devices=<i>ACTION</i>\n       If an input file is a device, FIFO or socket, use <i>ACTION</i> to process it.\n       By default, <i>ACTION</i> is read, which means that devices are read just as if they were\n       ordinary files. If <i>ACTION</i> is skip, devices are silently skipped.\n\n   -d <i>ACTION</i>\n   --directories=<i>ACTION</i>\n       If an input file is a directory, use <i>ACTION</i> to process it.\n       By default, <i>ACTION</i> is read, which means that directories are read just as if they\n       were ordinary files. If <i>ACTION</i> is skip, directories are silently skipped.\n       If <i>ACTION</i> is recurse, grep reads all files under each directory, recursively; this\n       is equivalent to the -r option.\n\n   -E\n   --extended-regexp\n       Interpret <i>PATTERN</i> as an <a href=\"grep-regex.html\">extended regular expression</a>.\n\n   -e <i>PATTERN</i>\n   --regexp=<i>PATTERN</i>\n       Use <i>PATTERN</i> as the pattern; useful to protect patterns beginning with -.\n\n   -F\n   --fixed-strings\n       Interpret <i>PATTERN</i> as a list of fixed strings, separated by newlines,\n       any of which is to be matched.\n\n   -f <i>FILE</i>\n   --file=<i>FILE</i>\n       Obtain patterns from <i>FILE</i>, one per line. The empty file contains zero\n       patterns, and therefore matches nothing.\n\n   -G\n   --basic-regexp\n       Interpret <i>PATTERN</i> as a <a href=\"grep-regex.html\">basic regular expression</a> This is the default.\n \n   -H\n   --with-filename\n       Print the filename for each match. \n   -h\n   --no-filename\n       Suppress the prefixing of filenames on output when multiple files are searched. \n   --help\n      Output a brief help message.\n\n   -I\n      Process a binary file as if it did not contain matching data; this is\n      equivalent to the --binary-files=without-match option.\n   -i\n   --ignore-case\n      Ignore case distinctions in both the <i>PATTERN</i> and the input files.\n\n   -L\n   --files-without-match\n      Suppress normal output; instead print the name of each input file from which\n      no output would normally have been printed. The scanning will stop on the first match. \n   -l\n   --files-with-matches\n      Suppress normal output; instead print the name of each input file from which\n      output would normally have been printed. The scanning will stop on the first match.\n\n   -m <i>NUM</i>\n   --max-count=<i>NUM</i>\n      Stop reading a file after NUM matching lines.\n      If the input is standard input from a regular file, and NUM matching lines are\n      output, grep ensures that the standard input is positioned to just after the last\n      matching line before exiting, regardless of the presence of trailing context lines.\n      This enables a calling process to resume a search. When grep stops after <i>NUM</i> matching\n      lines, it outputs any trailing context lines.\n      When the -c or --count option is also used, grep does not output a count greater\n      than <i>NUM</i>. When the -v or --invert-match option is also used, grep stops after\n      outputting <i>NUM</i> non-matching lines. \n   --mmap\n      If possible, use the mmap(2) system call to read input, instead of the default\n      read(2) system call. In some situations, --mmap yields better performance.\n      However, --mmap can cause undefined behavior (including core dumps) if an input\n      file shrinks while grep is operating, or if an I/O error occurs.\n\n   -n\n   --line-number\n      Prefix each line of output with the line number within its input file. \n\n   -o\n   --only-matching\n       Show only the part of a matching line that matches <i>PATTERN</i>.\n\n   --label=<i>LABEL</i>\n       Display input actually coming from standard input as input coming from file <i>LABEL</i>.\n       This is especially useful for tools like zgrep, e.g. gzip -cd foo.gz |grep --label=foo something \n   --line-buffered\n       Use line buffering, it can be a performance penality.\n\n   -P\n   --perl-regexp\n       Interpret <i>PATTERN</i> as a Perl regular expression.\n\n   -q\n   --quiet, --silent\n       Quiet; do not write anything to standard output.\n       Exit immediately with zero status if any match is found, even if an error\n       was detected. Also see the -s or --no-messages option.\n\n   -R\n   -r\n   --recursive\n       Read all files under each directory, recursively; this is equivalent to the '-d recurse' option. \n       Not all grep implementations support -r and among those that do, the behaviour with symlinks may differ.\n\n   --include=<i>PATTERN</i>\n       Recurse in directories only searching file matching <i>PATTERN</i>. \n   --exclude=<i>PATTERN</i>\n       Recurse in directories skip file matching <i>PATTERN</i>.\n \n   -s\n   --no-messages\n       Suppress error messages about nonexistent or unreadable files.\n       Portability note: unlike GNU grep, traditional grep did not conform to POSIX.2 ,\n       because traditional grep lacked a -q option and its -s option behaved like\n       GNU grep's -q option. Shell scripts intended to be portable to traditional grep\n       should avoid both -q and -s and should redirect output to /dev/null instead.\n\n   -U, --binary\n       Treat the file(s) as binary. \n       By default, under MS-DOS and MS-Windows, grep guesses the file type by looking at\n       the contents of the first 32KB read from the file. If grep decides the file is a\n       text file, it strips the CR characters from the original file contents\n       (to make regular expressions with ^ and $ work correctly).\n       Specifying -U overrules this guesswork, causing all files to be read and passed\n       to the matching mechanism verbatim; if the file is a text file with CR/LF pairs\n       at the end of each line, this will cause some regular expressions to fail.\n       This option has no effect on platforms other than MS-DOS and MS-Windows.\n \n   -u\n   --unix-byte-offsets\n       Report Unix-style byte offsets.\n       This switch causes grep to report byte offsets as if the file were a Unix-style text\n       file, i.e. with CR characters stripped off. This will produce results identical to\n       running grep on a Unix machine.\n       This option has no effect unless -b option is also used; it has no effect on\n       platforms other than MS-DOS and MS-Windows.\n\n   -V\n   --version\n       Print the version number of grep to standard error.\n       This version number should be included in all bug reports (see below). \n   -v\n   --invert-match\n       Invert the sense of matching, to select non-matching lines. \n   -w\n   --word-regexp\n       Select only those lines containing matches that form whole words.\n       The test is that the matching substring must either be at the beginning of\n       the line, or preceded by a non-word constituent character. Similarly, it\n       must be either at the end of the line or followed by a non-word constituent\n       character. Word-constituent characters are letters, digits, and the underscore.\n\n   -x\n   --line-regexp\n       Select only those matches that exactly match the whole line. \n   -y\n       Obsolete synonym for -i.\n   -Z\n   --null\n       Output a zero byte (the ASCII NUL character) instead of the character that\n       normally follows a file name. For example, grep -lZ outputs a zero byte after\n       each file name instead of the usual newline.\n       This option makes the output unambiguous, even in the presence of file names\n       containing unusual characters like newlines.\n       This option can be used with commands like find -print0, perl -0, sort -z, and\n       xargs -0 to process arbitrary file names, even those that contain newline characters.

To obtain better\n     compression, concatenate all input files before compressing them.\n\n--decompress\n--uncompress\n-d\n     Decompress.\n\n--force\n-f\n     Force compression or decompression even if the file has multiple\n     links or the corresponding file already exists, or if the\n     compressed data is read from or written to a terminal. If the\n     input data is not in a format recognized by 'gzip', and if the\n     option --stdout is also given, copy the input data without change\n     to the standard ouput: let 'zcat' behave as 'cat'. If '-f' is not\n     given, and when not running in the background, 'gzip' prompts to\n     verify whether an existing file should be overwritten.\n\n--help\n-h\n     Print a help message describing the options, then quit.\n\n--list\n-l\n     For each compressed file, list the following fields:\n\n          compressed size: size of the compressed file\n          uncompressed size: size of the uncompressed file\n          ratio: compression ratio (0.0% if unknown)\n          uncompressed_name: name of the uncompressed file\n\n          The uncompressed size is given as '-1' for files not\n           in 'gzip' format.\n\n--license\n-L\n     Display the 'gzip' license then quit.\n\n--no-name\n-n\n     When compressing, do not save the original file name and time\n     stamp by default. (The original name is always saved if the name\n     had to be truncated.) When decompressing, do not restore the\n     original file name if present (remove only the 'gzip' suffix from\n     the compressed file name) and do not restore the original time\n     stamp if present (copy it from the compressed file). This option\n     is the default when decompressing.\n\n--name\n-N\n     When compressing, always save the original file name and time\n     stamp; this is the default. When decompressing, restore the\n     original file name and time stamp if present. This option is\n     useful on systems which have a limit on file name length or when\n     the time stamp has been lost after a file transfer.\n\n--quiet\n-q\n     Suppress all warning messages.\n\n--recursive\n-r\n     Travel the directory structure recursively. If any of the file\n     names specified on the command line are directories, 'gzip' will\n     descend into the directory and compress all the files it finds\n     there (or decompress them in the case of 'gunzip').\n\n--suffix <i>SUF</i>\n-S <i>SUF</i>\n     Use suffix 'SUF' instead of '.gz'. Any suffix can be given, but\n     suffixes other than '.z' and '.gz' should be avoided to avoid\n     confusion when files are transferred to other systems.  A null\n     suffix forces gunzip to try decompression on all given files\n     regardless of suffix, as in:\n\n          gunzip -S \"\" *        (*.* for MSDOS)\n\n     Previous versions of gzip used the '.z' suffix. This was changed\n     to avoid a conflict with 'pack'.\n\n--test\n-t\n     Test. Check the compressed file integrity.\n\n--verbose\n-v\n     Verbose. Display the name and percentage reduction for each file\n     compressed.\n\n--version\n-V\n     Version. Display the version number and compilation options, then\n     quit.\n\n--fast\n--best\n-N\n     Regulate the speed of compression using the specified digit N,\n     where '-1' or '--fast' indicates the fastest compression method\n     (less compression) and '--best' or '-9' indicates the slowest\n     compression method (optimal compression).  The default\n     compression level is '-6' (that is, biased towards high\n     compression at expense of speed)."

Typical values for type are 10base2 (thin Ethernet),\n                   10baseT (twisted-pair 10Mbps Ethernet), AUI (external transceiver) and so on.\n                   The special medium type of auto can be used to tell the driver to auto-sense the\n                   media. Again, not all drivers can do this. \n\n   [-]broadcast [<i>addr</i>]    If the address argument is given, set the protocol broadcast address\n                          for this interface. Otherwise, set (or clear) the IFF_BROADCAST flag for\n                          the interface. \n\n   [-]pointopoint [<i>addr</i>]  This keyword enables the point-to-point mode of an interface,meaning that \n                          it is a direct link between two machines with nobody else listening on it.\n                          If the address argument is also given, set the protocol address of the other\n                          side of the link, just like the obsolete dstaddr keyword does.\n                          Otherwise, set or clear the IFF_POINTOPOINT flag for the interface. \n\n   hw <i>class address</i>    Set the hardware address of this interface, if the device driver supports\n                       this operation. The keyword must be followed by the name of the hardware class\n                       and the printable ASCII equivalent of the hardware address. Hardware classes\n                       currently supported include ether (Ethernet), ax25 (AMPR AX.25), ARCnet and\n                       netrom (AMPR NET/ROM). \n\n   multicast           Set the multicast flag on the interface.

If no names appear, the standard input is assumed.\n\n     The following single letter options are used to notify the line printer\n     spooler that the files are not standard text files. The spooling daemon\n     will use the appropriate filters to print the data accordingly.\n\n     -c      The files are assumed to contain data produced by cifplot(1)\n\n     -d      The files are assumed to contain data from tex (DVI format from\n             Stanford).\n\n     -f      Use a filter which interprets the first character of each line as\n             a standard FORTRAN carriage control character.\n\n     -g      The files are assumed to contain standard plot data as produced\n             by the plot routines (see also plot for the filters used by the\n             printer spooler).\n\n     -l      Use a filter which allows control characters to be printed and\n             suppresses page breaks.\n\n     -n      The files are assumed to contain data from ditroff (device independent\n              troff).\n\n     -p      Use pr(1) to format the files (equivalent to print).\n\n     -t      The files are assumed to contain data from troff(1) (cat photo-\n             typesetter commands).\n\n     -v      The files are assumed to contain a raster image for devices like\n             the Benson Varian.\n\n     These options apply to the handling of the print job:\n\n     -P      Force output to a specific printer.  Normally, the default printer\n             is used (site dependent), or the value of the environment\n             variable PRINTER is used.\n\n     -h      Suppress the printing of the burst page.\n\n     -m      Send mail upon completion.\n\n     -r      Remove the file upon completion of spooling. Can not be used with\n             the -s option, due to security concerns.\n\n     -s      Use symbolic links.  Usually files are copied to the spool directory.\n               The -s option will use symlink(2) to link data files\n             rather than trying to copy them so large files can be printed.\n             This means the files should not be modified or removed until they\n             have been printed.\n\n     The remaining options apply to copies, the page display, and headers:\n\n     -#<i>num</i>   The quantity num is the number of copies desired of each file\n             named.  For example,\n\n                   lpr -#3 foo.c bar.c more.c\n\n             would result in 3 copies of the file foo.c, followed by 3 copies\n             of the file bar.c, etc.  On the other hand,\n\n                   cat foo.c bar.c more.c | lpr -#3\n\n             will give three copies of the concatenation of the files. Often a\n             site will disable this feature to encourage use of a photocopier\n             instead.\n\n     -[1234]<i>font</i>\n             Specifies a font to be mounted on font position i. The daemon\n             will construct a .railmag file referencing the font pathname.\n\n     -C <i>class</i>\n             Job classification to use on the burst page.  For example,\n\n                   lpr -C EECS foo.c\n\n             causes the system name (the name returned by hostname(1))  to be\n             replaced on the burst page by EECS, and the file foo.c to be\n             printed.\n\n     -J <i>job</i>  Job name to print on the burst page.  Normally, the first file's\n             name is used.\n\n     -T <i>title</i>\n             Title name for pr(1),  instead of the file name.\n\n     -U <i>user</i>\n             User name to print on the burst page, also for accounting purposes.\n             This option is only honored if the real user-id is daemon\n             (or that specified in the printcap file instead of daemon), and\n             is intended for those instances where print filters wish to requeue\n              jobs.\n\n     -i [<i>numcols</i>]\n             The output is indented. If the next argument is numeric\n             (<i>numcols</i>), it is used as the number of blanks to be printed before\n             each line; otherwise, 8 characters are printed.\n\n     -w<i>num</i>   Uses <i>num</i> as the page width for pr(1).\n\nEnvironment\n     If the following environment variable exists, it is used by lpr:\n\n     PRINTER  Specifies an alternate default printer.\n\nFiles\n     /etc/passwd              Personal identification.\n     /etc/printcap            Printer capabilities data base.\n     /usr/sbin/lpd*           Line printer daemons.\n     /var/spool/output/*      Directories used for spooling.\n     /var/spool/output/*/cf*  Daemon control files.\n     /var/spool/output/*/df*  Data files specified in \"cf\" files.\n     /var/spool/output/*/tf*  Temporary copies of \"cf\" files.\n\nDiagnostics\n     If you try to spool too large a file, it will be truncated.  Lpr will object\n      to printing binary files.  If a user other than root prints a file\n     and spooling is disabled, lpr will print a message saying so and will not\n     put jobs in the queue.  If a connection to lpd(1) on the local machine\n     cannot be made, lpr will say that the daemon cannot be started.  Diagnostics\n     can be printed in the daemon's log file regarding missing spool\n     files by lpd(1).\n\nBugs\n     Fonts for troff(1) and tex reside on the host with the printer. It is\n     currently not possible to use local font libraries."

This level includes everything deemed useful.\n   -vvv Be even more verbose and display everything we are able to parse, even if it doesn't\n        look interesting at all (e.g., undefined memory regions).\n   -k   Show kernel drivers handling each device and also kernel modules capable of handling it.\n        Turned on by default when -v is given in the normal mode of output.\n        (Currently works only on Linux with kernel 2.6 or newer.)\n   -x   Show hexadecimal dump of the standard part of the configuration space\n        (the first 64 bytes or 128 bytes for CardBus bridges).\n   -xxx Show hexadecimal dump of the whole PCI configuration space.\n        It is available only to root as several PCI devices crash when you try to read some parts\n        of the config space (this behavior probably doesn't violate the PCI standard, but it's at\n        least very stupid). However, such devices are rare, so you needn't worry much.\n   -xxxx Show hexadecimal dump of the extended (4096-byte) PCI configuration space available\n         on PCI-X 2.0 and PCI Express buses.\n   -b   Bus-centric view. Show all IRQ numbers and addresses as seen by the cards on the\n        PCI bus instead of as seen by the kernel.\n   -D   Always show PCI domain numbers. By default, lspci suppresses them on machines which have only domain 0.\n\n   Options to control resolving ID's to names:\n\n   -n   Show PCI vendor and device codes as numbers instead of looking them up in the PCI ID list.\n   -nn  Show PCI vendor and device codes as both numbers and names.\n   -q   Use DNS to query the central PCI ID database if a device is not found in the local pci.ids file.\n        If the DNS query succeeds, the result is cached in ~/.pciids-cache and it is recognized in\n        subsequent runs even if -q is not given any more. Please use this switch inside automated scripts\n        only with caution to avoid overloading the database servers.\n   -qq  Same as -q, but the local cache is reset.\n   -Q   Query the central database even for entries which are recognized locally.\n        Use this if you suspect that the displayed entry is wrong.\n\n   Options for selection of devices:\n\n   -s [[[[<i>domain</i>]:]<i>bus</i>]:][<i>slot</i>][.[<i>func</i>]]\n           Show only devices in the specified domain (in case your machine has several host bridges,\n           they can either share a common bus number space or each of them can address a PCI domain of\n           its own; domains are numbered from 0 to ffff), bus (0 to ff), slot (0 to 1f) and function (0 to 7).\n           Each component of the device address can be omitted or set to \"*\", both meaning \"any value\".\n           All numbers are hexadecimal. E.g., \"0:\" means all devices on bus 0, \"0\" means all\n           functions of device 0 on any bus, \"0.3\" selects third function of device 0 on  all buses\n           and \".4\" shows only the fourth function of each device. \n   -d [<i>vendor</i>]:[<i>device</i>]\n           Show only devices with specified vendor and device ID. Both ID's are given in hexadecimal and\n           may be omitted or given as \"*\", both meaning \"any value\". \n\n   Other options:\n\n   -i <i>file</i>\n           Use <i>file</i> as the PCI ID list instead of /usr/share/hwdata/pci.ids. \n   -p <i>file</i>\n           Use <i>file</i> as the map of PCI ID's handled by kernel modules.\n           By default, lspci uses /lib/modules/kernel_version/modules.pcimap.\n           Applies only to Linux systems with recent enough module tools.\n\n   -M   Invoke bus mapping mode which performs a thorough scan of all PCI devices, including those behind\n        misconfigured bridges, etc. This option gives meaningful results only with a direct hardware access\n        mode, which usually requires root privileges. Please note that the bus mapper only scans PCI domain 0.\n   --version\n        Shows lspci version. This option should be used stand-alone. \n\n   PCI access options:\n\n        The PCI utilities use the PCI library to talk to PCI devices (see pcilib(7) for details).\n        You can use the following options to influence its behavior:\n   -A <i>method</i>\n        The library supports a variety of methods to access the PCI hardware.\n        By default, it uses the first access method available, but you can use this option to override\n        this decision. See -A help for a list of available methods and their descriptions. \n   -O <i>param</i>=<i>value</i>\n        The behavior of the library is controlled by several named parameters.\n        This option allows to set the value of any of the parameters.\n        Use -O help for a list of known parameters and their default values.\n\n   -H1  Use direct hardware access via Intel configuration mechanism 1. (This is a shorthand for -A intel-conf1.)\n\n   -H2  Use direct hardware access via Intel configuration mechanism 2. (This is a shorthand for -A intel-conf2.)\n\n   -F <i>file</i>\n        Instead of accessing real hardware, read the list of devices and values of their\n        configuration registers from the given file produced by an earlier run of lspci -x.\n        This is very useful for analysis of user-supplied bug reports, because you can display the hardware configuration\n        in any way you want without disturbing the user with requests for more dumps. \n\n   -G   Increase debug level of the library."

Otherwise, the entire man page will occupy one (long) page.\nMANROFFSEQ  If MANROFFSEQ is set, its value is used to determine the set of preprocessors run before running nroff or troff.\n            By default, pages are passed through the tbl preprocessor before nroff. \nMANSECT     If MANSECT is set, its value is used to determine which manual sections to search. \nMANWIDTH    If MANWIDTH is set, its value is used as the width manpages should be displayed.\n            Otherwise the pages can be displayed over the whole width of your screen. \nMANPAGER    If MANPAGER is set, its value is used as the name of the program to use to display the man page.\n            If not, then PAGER is used. If that has no value either, /usr/bin/less -is is used. \nBROWSER     The name of a browser to use for displaying HTML manual pages. If it is not set, /usr/bin/less -is is used. \nHTMLPAGER   The command to use for rendering HTML manual pages as text. If it is not set, /bin/cat is used. \nLANG        If LANG is set, its value defines the name of the subdirectory where man first looks for man pages.\n            Thus, the command 'LANG=dk man 1 foo' will cause man to look for the foo man page in .../dk/man1/foo.1,\n            and if it cannot find such a file, then in .../man1/foo.1, where ... is a directory on the search path.\nNLSPATH, LC_MESSAGES, LANG\n            The environment variables NLSPATH and LC_MESSAGES (or LANG when the latter does not exist) play a role in\n            locating the message catalog. (But the English messages are compiled in, and for English no catalog is\n            required.) Note that programs like col(1) called by man also use e.g. LC_CTYPE. \nPATH        PATH helps determine the search path for manual page files. See SEARCH PATH FOR MANUAL PAGES.\nSYSTEM      SYSTEM is used to get the default alternate system name (for use with the -m option)."

      "Display Switches\n  If no display switches are specified, pv behaves as if -p, -t, -e, -r, and -b had been given\n  (i.e. everything is switched on). Otherwise, only those display types that are explicitly switched on\n  will be shown.\n\n   -p, --progress\n       Turn the progress bar on.\n       If standard input is not a file and no size was given (with the -s modifier), the progress bar \n       cannot indicate how close to completion the transfer is, so it will just move left and right to \n       indicate thatdata is moving. \n   -t, --timer\n       Turn the timer on. This will display the total elapsed time that pv has been running for. \n   -e, --eta\n       Turn the ETA timer on. This will attempt to guess, based on previous transfer rates and the\n       total data size, how long it will be before completion. This option will have no effect if the\n       total data size cannot be determined. \n   -r, --rate\n       Turn the rate counter on. This will display the current rate of data transfer. \n   -b, --bytes\n       Turn the total byte counter on. This will display the total amount of data transferred so far. \n   -n, --numeric\n       Numeric output. Instead of giving a visual indication of progress, pv will give an integer\n       percentage, one per line, on standard error, suitable for piping (via convoluted redirection)\n       into dialog(1). Note that -f is not required if -n is being used. \n   -q, --quiet\n       No output. Useful if the -L option is being used on its own to just limit the transfer rate of a pipe.\n\nOutput Modifiers\n\n   -W, --wait\n       Wait until the first byte has been transferred before showing any progress information or calculating\n       any ETAs. Useful if the program you are piping to or from requires extra information before it starts,\n       eg piping data into gpg(1) or mcrypt(1) which require a passphrase before data can be processed. \n   -s SIZE, --size SIZE\n       Assume the total amount of data to be transferred is SIZE bytes when calculating percentages\n       and ETAs. The same suffixes of \"k\", \"m\" etc can be used as with -L. \n   -l, --line-mode\n       Instead of counting bytes, count lines (newline characters). The progress bar will only move when\n       a new line is found, and the value passed to the -s option will be interpreted as a line count. \n   -i <i>SEC</i>, --interval <i>SEC</i>\n       Wait SEC seconds between updates. The default is to update every second. Note that this can be a\n       decimal such as 0.1. \n   -w <i>WIDTH</i>, --width <i>WIDTH</i>\n       Assume the terminal is WIDTH characters wide, instead of trying to work it out (or assuming 80 if\n       it cannot be guessed). \n   -H <i>HEIGHT</i>, --height <i>HEIGHT</i>\n       Assume the terminal is HEIGHT rows high, instead of trying to work it out (or assuming 25 if it\n       cannot be guessed). \n   -N <i>NAME</i>, --name <i>NAME</i>\n       Prefix the output information with NAME. Useful in conjunction with -c if you have a complicated\n       pipeline and you want to be able to tell different parts of it apart. \n   -f, --force\n       Force output. Normally, pv will not output any visual display if standard error is not a terminal.\n       This option forces it to do so. \n   -c, --cursor\n       Use cursor positioning escape sequences instead of just using carriage returns.\n       This is useful in conjunction with -N (name) if you are using multiple pv invocations in a single,\n       long, pipeline.\n\nData Transfer Modifiers\n\n   -L <i>RATE</i>, --rate-limit <i>RATE</i>\n       Limit the transfer to a maximum of RATE bytes per second. \n       A suffix of \"k\", \"m\", \"g\", or \"t\" can be added to denote kilobytes (*1024), megabytes, and so on. \n   -B <i>BYTES</i>, --buffer-size <i>BYTES</i>\n       Use a transfer buffer size of BYTES bytes. A suffix of \"k\", \"m\", \"g\", or \"t\" can be added to denote\n       kilobytes (*1024), megabytes, and so on. The default buffer size is the block size of the input file's\n       filesystem multiplied by 32 (512kb max), or 400kb if the block size cannot be determined. \n   -R PID, --remote PID\n       If PID is an instance of pv that is already running, -R PID will cause that instance to act as\n       though it had been given this instance's command line instead. For example, if pv -L 123k is running\n       with process ID 9876, then running pv -R 9876 -L 321k will cause it to start using a rate limit of\n       321k instead of 123k. Note that some options cannot be changed while running, such as -c, -l, and -f.\n\nGeneral Options\n\n   -h, --help\n       Print a usage message on standard output and exit successfully. \n   -V, --version\n       Print version information on standard output and exit successfully."

Instead, the resulting line \n    is loaded into the Readline editing buffer, allowing further modification. \n\nhostcomplete\n    If set, and Readline is being used, Bash will attempt to perform hostname \n    completion when a word containing a <samp>'@'</samp> is being completed. \n    This option is enabled by default. \n\nhuponexit\n    If set, Bash will send <code><a href=\"pkill.html\">SIGHUP</a></code> to all jobs when an interactive login shell exits. \n\ninteractive_comments\n    Allow a word beginning with <samp>'#'</samp> to cause that word and all \n    remaining characters on that line to be ignored in an interactive shell.\n    This option is enabled by default. \n\nlithist\n    If enabled, and the <code>cmdhist</code> option is enabled, multi-line commands \n    are saved to the history with embedded newlines rather than using semicolon \n    separators where possible. \n\nmailwarn\n    If set, and a file that Bash is checking for mail has been accessed since the\n    last time it was checked, the message <code>\"The mail in <i>mailfile</i>  has been read\"</code> is<code>\n   </code> displayed.\n\nno_empty_cmd_completion\n    If set, and Readline is being used, Bash will not attempt to search the \n    <code>PATH</code> for possible completions when completion is attempted on \n    an empty line. \n\nnocaseglob\n    If set, Bash matches filenames in a case-insensitive fashion when performing \n    filename expansion. \n\nnullglob\n    If set, Bash allows filename patterns which match no files to expand to \n    a null string, rather than themselves. \n\nprogcomp\n    If set, the programmable completion facilities are enabled.\n    This option is enabled by default. \n\npromptvars\n    If set, prompt strings undergo variable and parameter expansion after being \n    expanded. This option is enabled by default. \n\nrestricted_shell\n    The shell sets this option if it is started in restricted mode. The value \n    can not be changed. This is not reset when the startup files are executed, \n    allowing the startup files to discover whether or not a shell is restricted. \n\nshift_verbose\n    If this is set, the <code>shift</code> builtin prints an error message when \n    the shift count exceeds the number of positional parameters. \n\nsourcepath\n    If set, the <code>source</code> builtin uses the value of <code>PATH</code>  to find the directory containing\n    the file supplied as an argument. This option is enabled by default.\n\nxpg_echo\n    If set, the <code>echo</code> builtin expands backslash-escape sequences \n    by default."

      "  -b\n     Ignore leading blanks when finding sort keys in each line.\n\n  -d\n     Sort in \"phone directory\" order: ignore all characters except\n     letters, digits and blanks when sorting.\n\n  -f\n     Fold lowercase characters into the equivalent uppercase characters\n     when sorting so that, for example, 'b' and 'B' sort as equal.\n\n  -g\n     Sort numerically, using the standard C function 'strtod' to convert\n     a prefix of each line to a double-precision floating point number.\n     This allows floating point numbers to be specified in scientific\n     notation, like '1.0e-34' and '10e100'.  Do not report overflow,\n     underflow, or conversion errors.  Use the following collating\n     sequence:\n\n        * Lines that do not start with numbers (all considered to be\n          equal).\n\n        * NaNs (\"Not a Number\" values, in IEEE floating point\n          arithmetic) in a consistent but machine-dependent order.\n\n        * Minus infinity.\n\n        * Finite numbers in ascending numeric order (with -0 and +0\n          equal).\n\n        * Plus infinity.\n\n     Use this option only if there is no alternative; it is much slower\n     than '-n' and it can lose information when converting to floating\n     point.\n\n  -i\n     Ignore unprintable characters.\n\n  -M\n     An initial string, consisting of any amount of whitespace, followed\n     by a month name abbreviation, is folded to UPPER case and compared\n     in the order 'JAN' &lt; 'FEB' &lt; ... &lt; 'DEC'.  Invalid names compare\n     low to valid names.  The 'LC_TIME' locale determines the month\n     spellings.\n\n  -n\n     Sort numerically: the number begins each line; specifically, it\n     consists of optional whitespace, an optional '-' sign, and zero or\n     more digits possibly separated by thousands separators, optionally\n     followed by a radix character and zero or more digits.  The\n     'LC_NUMERIC' locale specifies the radix character and thousands\n     separator.\n\n     'sort -n' uses what might be considered an unconventional method\n     to compare strings representing floating point numbers.  Rather\n     than first converting each string to the C 'double' type and then\n     comparing those values, sort aligns the radix characters in the two\n     strings and compares the strings a character at a time.  One\n     benefit of using this approach is its speed.  In practice this is\n     much more efficient than performing the two corresponding\n     string-to-double (or even string-to-integer) conversions and then\n     comparing doubles.  In addition, there is no corresponding loss of\n     precision.  Converting each string to 'double' before comparison\n     would limit precision to about 16 digits on most systems.\n\n     Neither a leading '+' nor exponential notation is recognized.  To\n     compare such strings numerically, use the '-g' option.\n\n  -r\n     Reverse the result of comparison, so that lines with greater key\n     values appear earlier in the output instead of later.\n\n<b>Other options</b>:\n\n  -o <i>OUTPUT-FILE</i>\n     Write output to <i>OUTPUT-FILE</i> instead of standard output.  If\n     <i>OUTPUT-FILE</i> is one of the input files, 'sort' copies it to a\n     temporary file before sorting and writing the output to\n     <i>OUTPUT-FILE</i>.\n\n  -t <i>SEPARATOR</i>\n     Use character <i>SEPARATOR</i> as the field separator when finding the\n     sort keys in each line.  By default, fields are separated by the\n     empty string between a non-whitespace character and a whitespace\n     character.  That is, given the input line ' foo bar', 'sort'\n     breaks it into fields ' foo' and ' bar'.  The field separator is\n     not considered to be part of either the field preceding or the\n     field following.\n\n  -u\n     For the default case or the '-m' option, only output the first of\n     a sequence of lines that compare equal.  For the '-c' option,\n     check that no pair of consecutive lines compares equal.\n\n  -k <i>POS1</i>[,<i>POS2</i>]\n     The recommended, POSIX, option for specifying a sort field.  The\n     field consists of the part of the line between POS1 and POS2 (or\n     the end of the line, if POS2 is omitted), _inclusive_.  Fields and\n     character positions are numbered starting with 1.  So to sort on\n     the second field, you'd use '-k 2,2' See below for more examples.\n\n  -z\n     Treat the input as a set of lines, each terminated by a zero byte\n     (ASCII NUL (Null) character) instead of an ASCII LF (Line Feed).\n     This option can be useful in conjunction with 'perl -0' or 'find\n     -print0' and 'xargs -0' which do the same in order to reliably\n     handle arbitrary pathnames (even those which contain Line Feed\n     characters.)\n\n'+<i>POS1</i>[-<i>POS2</i>]\n     The obsolete, traditional option for specifying a sort field.  \n     The field consists of the line between POS1 and up to but _not\n     including_ POS2 (or the end of the line if POS2 is omitted).\n     Fields and character positions are numbered starting with 0.  \n     See below.\n\n  --help\n\n  --version",

The\n             compression algorithm is the same used by gzip(1), and the\n             “level” can be controlled by the <b>CompressionLevel</b> option for\n             protocol version 1.  Compression is desirable on modem lines and\n             other slow connections, but will only slow down things on fast\n             networks.  The default value can be set on a host-by-host basis\n             in the configuration files; see the <b>Compression</b> option.\n\n     <b>-c</b> <u>cipher_spec</u>\n\n             Selects the cipher specification for encrypting the session.\n\n             Protocol version 1 allows specification of a single cipher.  The\n             supported values are “3des”, “blowfish”, and “des”.  <u>3des</u>\n             (triple-des) is an encrypt-decrypt-encrypt triple with three\n             different keys.  It is believed to be secure.  <u>blowfish</u> is a fast\n             block cipher; it appears very secure and is much faster than\n             <u>3des</u>.  <u>des</u> is only supported in the <b>ssh</b> client for\n             interoperability with legacy protocol 1 implementations that do\n             not support the <u>3des</u> cipher.  Its use is strongly discouraged due\n             to cryptographic weaknesses.  The default is “3des”.\n\n             For protocol version 2, <u>cipher_spec</u> is a comma-separated list of\n             ciphers listed in order of preference.  See the <b>Ciphers</b> keyword\n             for more information.\n\n     <b>-D</b> [<u>bind_address</u>:]<u>port</u>\n\n             Specifies a local “dynamic” application-level port forwarding.\n             This works by allocating a socket to listen to <u>port</u> on the local\n             side, optionally bound to the specified <u>bind_address</u>.  Whenever a\n             connection is made to this port, the connection is forwarded over\n             the secure channel, and the application protocol is then used to\n             determine where to connect to from the remote machine.  Currently\n             the SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols are supported, and <b>ssh</b> will act\n             as a SOCKS server.  Only root can forward privileged ports.\n             Dynamic port forwardings can also be specified in the\n             configuration file.\n\n             IPv6 addresses can be specified with an alternative syntax:\n             [<u>bind_address</u>/]<u>port</u> or by enclosing the address in square\n             brackets.  Only the superuser can forward privileged ports.  By\n             default, the local port is bound in accordance with the\n             <b>GatewayPorts</b> setting.  However, an explicit <u>bind_address</u> can be\n             used to bind the connection to a specific address.  The\n             <u>bind_address</u> of “localhost” indicates that the listening port be\n             bound for local use only, while an empty address or ‘*’ indicates\n             that the port should be available from all interfaces.\n\n     <b>-e</b> <u>escape_char</u>\n\n             Sets the escape character for sessions with a pty (default: ‘~’).\n             The escape character is only recognized at the beginning of a\n             line.  The escape character followed by a dot (‘.’) closes the\n             connection; followed by control-Z suspends the connection; and\n             followed by itself sends the escape character once.  Setting the\n             character to “none” disables any escapes and makes the session\n             fully transparent.\n\n     <b>-F</b> <u>configfile</u>\n             Specifies an alternative per-user configuration file.  If a\n             configuration file is given on the command line, the system-wide\n             configuration file (<u>/etc/ssh/ssh_config</u>) will be ignored.  The\n             default for the per-user configuration file is <u>~/.ssh/config</u>.\n\n     <b>-f</b>      Requests <b>ssh</b> to go to background just before command execution.\n             This is useful if <b>ssh</b> is going to ask for passwords or\n             passphrases, but the user wants it in the background.  This\n             implies <b>-n</b>.  The recommended way to start X11 programs at a\n             remote site is with something like <b>ssh</b> <b>-f</b> <b>host</b> <b>xterm</b>.\n\n             If the <b>ExitOnForwardFailure</b> configuration option is set to “yes”,\n             then a client started with <b>-f</b> will wait for all remote port\n             forwards to be successfully established before placing itself in\n             the background.\n\n     <b>-g</b>      Allows remote hosts to connect to local forwarded ports.\n\n     <b>-I</b> <u>smartcard_device</u>\n\n             Specify the device <b>ssh</b> should use to communicate with a smartcard\n             used for storing the user’s private RSA key.  This option is only\n             available if support for smartcard devices is compiled in\n             (default is no support).\n\n     <b>-i</b> <u>identity_file</u>\n             Selects a file from which the identity (private key) for RSA or\n             DSA authentication is read.  The default is <u>~/.ssh/identity</u> for\n             protocol version 1, and <u>~/.ssh/id_rsa</u> and <u>~/.ssh/id_dsa</u> for\n             protocol version 2.  Identity files can also be specified on a\n             per-host basis in the configuration file.  It is possible to have\n             multiple <b>-i</b> options (and multiple identities specified in\n             configuration files).\n\n     <b>-K</b>      Enables GSSAPI-based authentication and forwarding (delegation)\n             of GSSAPI credentials to the server.\n\n     <b>-k</b>      Disables forwarding (delegation) of GSSAPI credentials to the\n             server.\n\n     <b>-L</b> [<u>bind_address</u>:]<u>port</u>:<u>host</u>:<u>hostport</u>\n\n             Specifies that the given port on the local (client) host is to be\n             forwarded to the given host and port on the remote side.  This\n             works by allocating a socket to listen to <u>port</u> on the local side,\n             optionally bound to the specified <u>bind_address</u>.  Whenever a\n             connection is made to this port, the connection is forwarded over\n             the secure channel, and a connection is made to <u>host</u> port\n             <u>hostport</u> from the remote machine.  Port forwardings can also be\n             specified in the configuration file.  IPv6 addresses can be\n             specified with an alternative syntax:\n             [<u>bind_address</u>/]<u>port</u>/<u>host</u>/<u>hostport</u> or by enclosing the address in\n             square brackets.  Only the superuser can forward privileged\n             ports.  By default, the local port is bound in accordance with\n             the <b>GatewayPorts</b> setting.  However, an explicit <u>bind_address</u> may\n             be used to bind the connection to a specific address.  The\n             <u>bind_address</u> of “localhost” indicates that the listening port be\n             bound for local use only, while an empty address or ‘*’ indicates\n             that the port should be available from all interfaces.\n\n     <b>-l</b> <u>login_name</u>\n\n             Specifies the user to log in as on the remote machine.  This also\n             may be specified on a per-host basis in the configuration file.\n\n     <b>-M</b>      Places the <b>ssh</b> client into \"primary\" mode for connection sharing.\n             Multiple <b>-M</b> options places <b>ssh</b> into \"primary\" mode with\n             confirmation required before replica connections are accepted.\n             Refer to the description of <b>ControlMaster</b> in ssh_config(5) for\n             details.\n\n     <b>-m</b> <u>mac_spec</u>\n\n             Additionally, for protocol version 2 a comma-separated list of\n             MAC (message authentication code) algorithms can be specified in\n             order of preference.  See the <b>MACs</b> keyword for more information.\n\n     <b>-N</b>      Do not execute a remote command.  This is useful for just\n             forwarding ports (protocol version 2 only).\n\n     <b>-n</b>      Redirects stdin from <u>/dev/null</u> (actually, prevents reading from\n             stdin).  This must be used when <b>ssh</b> is run in the background.  A\n             common trick is to use this to run X11 programs on a remote\n             machine.  For example, <b>ssh</b> <b>-n</b> <b>shadows.cs.hut.fi</b> <b>emacs</b> <b>&amp;</b> will\n             start an emacs on shadows.cs.hut.fi, and the X11 connection will\n             be automatically forwarded over an encrypted channel.  The <b>ssh</b>\n\n             program will be put in the background.  (This does not work if\n             <b>ssh</b> needs to ask for a password or passphrase; see also the <b>-f</b>\n             option.)\n\n     <b>-O</b> <u>ctl_cmd</u>\n             Control an active connection multiplexing primary process.  When\n             the <b>-O</b> option is specified, the <u>ctl_cmd</u> argument is interpreted\n             and passed to the primary process.  Valid commands are: \"check\"\n             (check that the primary process is running) and \"exit\" (request\n             the primary to exit).\n\n     <b>-o</b> <u>option</u>\n\n             Can be used to give options in the format used in the\n             configuration file.  This is useful for specifying options for\n             which there is no separate command-line flag.  For full details\n             of the options listed below, and their possible values, see\n             ssh_config(5).\n\n                   AddressFamily\n                   BatchMode\n                   BindAddress\n                   ChallengeResponseAuthentication\n                   CheckHostIP\n                   Cipher\n                   Ciphers\n                   ClearAllForwardings\n                   Compression\n                   CompressionLevel\n                   ConnectionAttempts\n                   ConnectTimeout\n                   ControlMaster\n                   ControlPath\n                   DynamicForward\n                   EscapeChar\n                   ExitOnForwardFailure\n                   ForwardAgent\n                   ForwardX11\n                   ForwardX11Trusted\n                   GatewayPorts\n                   GlobalKnownHostsFile\n                   GSSAPIAuthentication\n                   GSSAPIDelegateCredentials\n                   HashKnownHosts\n                   Host\n                   HostbasedAuthentication\n                   HostKeyAlgorithms\n                   HostKeyAlias\n                   HostName\n                   IdentityFile\n                   IdentitiesOnly\n                   KbdInteractiveDevices\n                   LocalCommand\n                   LocalForward\n                   LogLevel\n                   MACs\n                   NoHostAuthenticationForLocalhost\n                   NumberOfPasswordPrompts\n                   PasswordAuthentication\n                   PermitLocalCommand\n                   Port\n                   PreferredAuthentications\n                   Protocol\n                   ProxyCommand\n                   PubkeyAuthentication\n                   RekeyLimit\n                   RemoteForward\n                   RhostsRSAAuthentication\n                   RSAAuthentication\n                   SendEnv\n                   ServerAliveInterval\n                   ServerAliveCountMax\n                   SmartcardDevice\n                   StrictHostKeyChecking\n                   TCPKeepAlive\n                   Tunnel\n                   TunnelDevice\n                   UsePrivilegedPort\n                   User\n                   UserKnownHostsFile\n                   VerifyHostKeyDNS\n                   VisualHostKey\n                   XAuthLocation\n\n     <b>-p</b> <u>port</u>\n             Port to connect to on the remote host.  This can be specified on\n             a per-host basis in the configuration file.\n\n     <b>-q</b>      Quiet mode.  Causes most warning and diagnostic messages to be\n             suppressed.  Only fatal errors are displayed.  If a second <b>-q</b> is\n             given then even fatal errors are suppressed, except for those\n             produced due solely to bad arguments.\n\n     <b>-R</b> [<u>bind_address</u>:]<u>port</u>:<u>host</u>:<u>hostport</u>\n\n             Specifies that the given port on the remote (server) host is to\n             be forwarded to the given host and port on the local side.  This\n             works by allocating a socket to listen to <u>port</u> on the remote\n             side, and whenever a connection is made to this port, the\n             connection is forwarded over the secure channel, and a connection\n             is made to <u>host</u> port <u>hostport</u> from the local machine.\n\n             Port forwardings can also be specified in the configuration file.\n             Privileged ports can be forwarded only when logging in as root on\n             the remote machine.  IPv6 addresses can be specified by enclosing\n             the address in square braces or using an alternative syntax:\n             [<u>bind_address</u>/]<u>host</u>/<u>port</u>/<u>hostport</u>.\n\n             By default, the listening socket on the server will be bound to\n             the loopback interface only.  This can be overridden by\n             specifying a <u>bind_address</u>.  An empty <u>bind_address</u>, or the address\n             ‘*’, indicates that the remote socket should listen on all\n             interfaces.  Specifying a remote <u>bind_address</u> will only succeed\n             if the server’s <b>GatewayPorts</b> option is enabled (see\n             sshd_config(5)).\n\n             If the <u>port</u> argument is ‘0’, the listen port will be dynamically\n             allocated on the server and reported to the client at run time.\n\n     <b>-S</b> <u>ctl_path</u>\n\n             Specifies the location of a control socket for connection\n             sharing, or the string “none” to disable connection sharing.\n             Refer to the description of <b>ControlPath</b> and <b>ControlMaster</b> in\n             ssh_config(5) for details.\n\n     <b>-s</b>      Used to request invocation of a subsystem on the remote\n             system.  Subsystems are a feature of the SSH2 protocol which\n             facilitate the use of SSH as a secure transport for other\n             applications (eg. sftp(1)).  The subsystem is specified as the\n             remote command.\n\n     <b>-T</b>      Disable pseudo-tty allocation.\n\n     <b>-t</b>      Force pseudo-tty allocation.  This can be used to execute\n             arbitrary screen-based programs on a remote machine, which can be\n             very useful, e.g. when implementing menu services.  Multiple <b>-t</b>\n\n             options force tty allocation, even if <b>ssh</b> has no local tty.\n\n     <b>-V</b>      Display the version number and exit.\n\n     <b>-v</b>      Verbose mode.  Causes <b>ssh</b> to print debugging messages about its\n             progress.  This is helpful in debugging connection,\n             authentication, and configuration problems.  Multiple <b>-v</b> options\n             increase the verbosity.  The maximum is 3.\n\n     <b>-w</b> <u>local_tun</u>[:<u>remote_tun</u>]\n             Requests tunnel device forwarding with the specified tun(4)\n             devices between the client (<u>local_tun</u>) and the server\n             (<u>remote_tun</u>).\n\n             The devices can be specified by numerical ID or the keyword\n             “any”, which uses the next available tunnel device.  If\n             <u>remote_tun</u> is not specified, it defaults to “any”.  See also the\n             <b>Tunnel</b> and <b>TunnelDevice</b> directives in ssh_config(5).  If the\n             <b>Tunnel</b> directive is unset, it is set to the default tunnel mode,\n             which is “point-to-point”.\n\n     <b>-X</b>      Enables X11 forwarding.  This can also be specified on a per-host\n             basis in a configuration file.\n\n             X11 forwarding should be enabled with caution.  Users with the\n             ability to bypass file permissions on the remote host (for the\n             user’s X authorization database) can access the local X11 display\n             through the forwarded connection.  An attacker could then  perform\n             activities such as keystroke monitoring.\n\n             For this reason, X11 forwarding is subjected to X11 SECURITY\n             extension restrictions by default.  Please refer to the <b>ssh</b> <b>-Y</b>\n\n             option and the <b>ForwardX11Trusted</b> directive in ssh_config(5) for\n             more information.\n\n     <b>-x</b>      Disables X11 forwarding.\n\n     <b>-Y</b>      Enables trusted X11 forwarding.  Trusted X11 forwardings are not\n             subjected to the X11 SECURITY extension controls.\n\n     <b>-y</b>      Send log information using the syslog(3) system module.  By\n             default this information is sent to stderr.\n\n     <b>ssh</b> can additionally obtain configuration data from a per-user\n     configuration file and a system-wide configuration file.  The file format\n     and configuration options are described in ssh_config(5).\n\n     <b>ssh</b> exits with the exit status of the remote command or with 255 if an\n     error occurred.",

If -c is used with -f or -F (below), only aggregate\n       totals for all traced processes are kept.\n\n   -D  (Not available on SVR4 and FreeBSD.) Run tracer process as a detached grandchild,\n       not as parent of the tracee. This reduces the visible effect of strace by keeping the\n       tracee a direct child of the calling process.\n\n   -d  Show some debugging output of strace itself on the standard error.\n\n   -e <i>expr</i>\n       A qualifying expression which modifies which events to trace or how to trace them.\n       The format of the expression is:\n          [qualifier=][!]value1[,value2]...\n       where qualifier is one of trace, abbrev, verbose, raw, signal, read, or write and value\n       is a qualifier-dependent symbol or number. The default qualifier is trace. Using an\n       exclamation mark negates the set of values. For example, -eopen means literally\n          -e trace=open which in turn means trace only the open system call.\n       By contrast, -etrace=!open means to trace every system call except open.\n       In addition, the special values all and none have the obvious meanings.\n\n       Note that some shells use the exclamation point for history expansion even inside quoted\n       arguments. If so, you must escape the exclamation point with a backslash.\n   -e trace=<i>set</i>\n       Trace only the specified set of system calls.\n       The -c option is useful for determining which system calls might be useful to trace.\n       For example, trace=open,close,read,write means to only trace those four system calls.\n       Be careful when making inferences about the user/kernel boundary if only a subset of\n       system calls are being monitored. The default is trace=all.\n   -e trace=<i>file</i>\n       Trace all system calls which take a file name as an argument.\n       You can think of this as an abbreviation for -e trace=open,stat,chmod,unlink,... which is\n       useful to seeing what files the process is referencing. Furthermore, using the\n       abbreviation will ensure that you don't accidentally forget to include a call like lstat\n       in the list. Betchya woulda forgot that one.\n   -e trace=<i>process</i>\n       Trace all system calls which involve process management. This is useful for watching\n       the fork, wait, and exec steps of a process. \n   -e trace=<i>network</i>\n       Trace all the network related system calls. \n   -e trace=<i>signal</i>\n       Trace all signal related system calls. \n   -e trace=<i>ipc</i>\n       Trace all IPC related system calls. \n   -e trace=<i>desc</i>\n       Trace all file descriptor related system calls. \n   -e abbrev=<i>set</i>\n       Abbreviate the output from printing each member of large structures.\n       The default is abbrev=all. The -v option has the effect of abbrev=none. \n   -e verbose=<i>set</i>\n       Dereference structures for the specified set of system calls. The default is verbose=all. \n   -e raw=<i>set</i>\n       Print raw, undecoded arguments for the specified set of system calls. This option has\n       the effect of causing all arguments to be printed in hexadecimal. This is mostly\n       useful if you don't trust the decoding or you need to know the actual numeric value\n       of an argument.\n   -e signal=<i>set</i>\n       Trace only the specified subset of signals. The default is signal=all.\n       For example, signal=!SIGIO (or signal=!io) causes SIGIO signals not to be traced. \n   -e read=<i>set</i>\n       Perform a full hexadecimal and ASCII dump of all the data read from file descriptors\n       listed in the specified set. For example, to see all input activity on file\n       descriptors 3 and 5 use -e read=3,5. Note that this is independent from the normal\n       tracing of the read(2) system call which is controlled by the option -e trace=read.\n   -e write=<i>set</i>\n       Perform a full hexadecimal and ASCII dump of all the data written to file descriptors\n       listed in the specified set. For example, to see all output activity on file\n       descriptors 3 and 5 use -e write=3,5. Note that this is independent from the normal\n       tracing of the write(2) system call which is controlled by the option -e trace=write. \n\n   -E var=<i>val</i>\n       Run command with var=val in its list of environment variables.\n   -E <i>var</i>\n       Remove var from the inherited list of environment variables before passing it on to the command. \n\n   -f  Trace child processes as they are created by currently traced processes as a result of\n       the fork(2) system call.  On non-Linux platforms the new process is attached to as\n       soon as its pid is known (through the return value of fork(2) in the parent process).\n       This means that such children can run uncontrolled for a while (especially in the case\n       of a vfork(2)), until the parent is scheduled again to complete its (v)fork(2) call.\n       On Linux the child is traced from its first instruction with no delay. If the parent\n       process decides to wait(2) for a child that is currently being traced, it is suspended\n       until an appropriate child process either terminates or incurs a signal that would cause\n       it to terminate (as determined from the child's current signal disposition).\n\n       On SunOS 4.x the tracing of vforks is accomplished with some dynamic linking trickery.\n\n   -ff If the -o filename option is in effect, each processes trace is written to filename.pid\n       where pid is the numeric process id of each process. This is incompatible with -c, since\n       no per-process counts are kept.\n\n   -F  This option is now obsolete and it has the same functionality as -f.\n\n   -h  Print the help summary.\n\n   -i  Print the instruction pointer at the time of the system call.\n\n   -o <i>filename</i>\n       Write the trace output to the file filename rather than to stderr.\n       Use filename.pid if -ff is used. If the argument begins with '|' or with '!' then the\n       rest of the argument is treated as a command and all output is piped to it. This is\n       convenient for piping the debugging output to a program without affecting the\n       redirections of executed programs.\n\n   -O overhead\n       Set the overhead for tracing system calls to overhead microseconds. This is useful for\n       overriding the default heuristic for guessing how much time is spent in mere measuring\n       when timing system calls using the -c option. The accuracy of the heuristic can be\n       gauged by timing a given program run without tracing (using time(1)) and comparing\n       the accumulated system call time to the total produced using -c.\n\n   -p pid\n       Attach to the process with the process ID pid and begin tracing. The trace can be\n       terminated at any time by a keyboard interrupt signal ( CTRL -C). strace will respond\n       by detaching itself from the traced process(es) leaving it (them) to continue running.\n       Multiple -p options can be used to attach to up to 32 processes in addition to command\n       (which is optional if at least one -p option is given).\n\n   -q  Suppress messages about attaching, detaching etc. This happens automatically when output\n       is redirected to a file and the command is run directly instead of attaching.\n\n   -r  Print a relative timestamp upon entry to each system call. This records the time\n       difference between the beginning of successive system calls.\n\n   -s <i>strsize</i>\n       Specify the maximum string size to print (the default is 32). Note that filenames are\n       not considered strings and are always printed in full.\n\n   -S <i>sortby</i>\n       Sort the output of the histogram printed by the -c option by the specified criterion.\n       Legal values are time, calls, name, and nothing (default time).\n\n   -t  Prefix each line of the trace with the time of day.\n\n   -tt If given twice, the time printed will include the microseconds.\n\n   -ttt  If given thrice, the time printed will include the microseconds and the leading portion\n         will be printed as the number of seconds since the epoch.\n\n   -T  Show the time spent in system calls. This records the time difference between the\n       beginning and the end of each system call.\n\n   -u <i>username</i>\n       Run command with the user ID , group ID , and supplementary groups of username.\n       This option is only useful when running as root and enables the correct execution of\n       setuid and/or setgid binaries. Unless this option is used setuid and setgid programs\n       are executed without effective privileges.\n\n   -v  Print unabbreviated versions of environment, stat, termios, etc. calls. These structures\n       are very common in calls and so the default behavior displays a reasonable subset of\n       structure members. Use this option to get all of the gory details.\n\n   -V  Print the version number of strace.\n\n   -x  Print all non-ASCII strings in hexadecimal string format.\n\n   -xx Print all strings in hexadecimal string format."

By default, sudo does\n        not modify HOME (see set_home and always_set_home in sudoers(5)).\n\n   -K  (sure kill) like kill (-k) except that it removes the user's timestamp\n        entirely. Like -k, this option does not require a password.\n\n   -L   list defaults, list out the parameters that can be set in a Defaults\n        line along with a short description for each. This option is useful\n        in conjunction with grep(1).\n\n   -P   Preserve group vector, causes sudo to preserve the invoking user's\n        group vector unaltered. By default, sudo will initialize the group\n        vector to the list of groups the target user is in. The real and\n        effective group IDs, however, are still set to match the target user.\n\n   -S   stdin, read the password from the standard input instead of the terminal.\n\n   -V   Version, print the version number and exit.\n        If the invoking user is already root the -V option will print out a\n        list of the defaults sudo was compiled with as well as the machine's\n        local network addresses.\n\n   -a   Authentication type, use the specified authentication type when\n        validating the user, as allowed by /etc/login.conf. The system\n        administrator can specify a list of sudo-specific authentication\n        methods by adding an \"auth-sudo\" entry in /etc/login.conf.\n        This option is only available on systems that support BSD\n        authentication where sudo has been configured with the\n        --with-bsdauth option.\n\n   -b   Background, run the given command in the background.\n        Note that if you use the -b option you cannot use shell\n        job control to manipulate the process.\n\n   -c   Class, run the specified command with resources limited by\n        the specified login class. The class argument can be either a\n        class name as defined in /etc/login.conf, or a single '-' character.\n        Specifying a class of -indicates that the command should be run\n        restricted by the default login capabilities for the user the\n        command is run as. If the class argument specifies an existing user\n        class, the command must be run as root, or the sudo command must be\n        run from a shell that is already root.\n        This option is only available on systems with BSD login classes\n        where sudo has been configured with the --with-logincap option.\n\n   -e   Edit, instead of running a command, the user wishes to edit one\n        or more files. In lieu of a command, the string \"sudoedit\" is\n        used when consulting the sudoers file. If the user is authorized\n        by sudoers the following steps are taken:\n         1. Temporary copies are made of the files to be edited with the\n            owner set to the invoking user.\n         2. The editor specified by the VISUAL or EDITOR environment variables\n            is run to edit the temporary files. If neither VISUAL nor EDITOR\n            are set, the program listed in the editor sudoers variable is used.\n         3. If they have been modified, the temporary files are copied back\n            to their original location and the temporary versions are removed. \n        If the specified file does not exist, it will be created.\n        Note that unlike most commands run by sudo, the editor is run with the\n        invoking user's environment unmodified. If, for some reason, sudo is\n        unable to update a file with its edited version, the user will receive\n        a warning and the edited copy will remain in a temporary file. \n\n   -h   Help, print a usage message and exit.\n\n   -i   Simulate initial login, run the shell specified in the passwd(5) entry\n        of the user that the command is being run as. The command name argument\n        given to the shell begins with a - to tell the shell to run as a login shell.\n        sudo attempts to change to that user's home directory before running the shell.\n        It also initializes the environment, leaving TERM unchanged, setting HOME ,\n        SHELL , USER , LOGNAME , and PATH , and unsetting all other environment variables.\n        Note that because the shell to use is determined before the sudoers file is\n        parsed, a runas_default setting in sudoers will specify the user to run the\n        shell as but will not affect which shell is actually run.\n\n   -k   Kill, invalidates the user's timestamp by setting the time on it to the epoch.\n        The next time sudo is run a password will be required.\n        This option does not require a password and was added to allow a user to\n        revoke sudo permissions from a .logout file.\n\n   -l   List, list out the allowed (and forbidden) commands for the user on the current host.\n\n   -p   Prompt, allows you to override the default password prompt and use a custom one.\n        The following percent ('%') escapes are supported:\n         %u  expanded to the invoking user's login name\n         %U  expanded to the login name of the user the command will be run as (defaults to root)\n         %h  expanded to the local hostname without the domain name\n         %H  expanded to the local hostname including the domain name\n            (on if the machine's hostname is fully qualified or the fqdn sudoers option is set)\n         %%  two consecutive % characters are collapsed into a single % character\n\n  -s    Shell, runs the shell specified by the SHELL environment variable if it is\n        set or the shell as specified in passwd(5).\n\n   -u   User, causes sudo to run the specified command as a user other than root.\n        To specify a uid instead of a username, use #uid.\n        Note that if the targetpw Defaults option is set (see sudoers(5)) it is\n        not possible to run commands with a uid not listed in the password database.\n\n   -v   Validate, sudo will update the user's timestamp, prompting for the user's password\n        if necessary. This extends the sudo timeout for another 5 minutes (or whatever\n        the timeout is set to in sudoers) but does not run a command.\n\n   --   Indicates that sudo should stop processing command line arguments.\n        It is most useful in conjunction with the -s flag.

This reference also has useful information for those\n     not being overly familiar with the Unix permission system.\n\n     Of course, <i>PERMISSIONS</i> might be plainly specified as an octal\n     number.  However, by using generic symbolic modifications to mode\n     bits, this allows more flexibility.

Prevents 'tar' from recursing into\n     directories that are on different file systems from the current\n     directory.\n\n--owner=<i>USER</i>\n     Specifies that 'tar' should use <i>USER</i> as the owner of members when\n     creating archives, instead of the user associated with the source\n     file.  USER is first decoded as a user symbolic name, but if this\n     interpretation fails, it has to be a decimal numeric user ID.\n\n     There is no value indicating a missing number, and '0' usually\n     means 'root'.  Some people like to force '0' as the value to offer\n     in their distributions for the owner of files, because the 'root'\n     user is anonymous anyway, so that might as well be the owner of\n     anonymous archives.\n\n--portability\n--old-archive\n-o\n     Tells 'tar' to create an archive that is compatible with Unix V7\n     'tar'.\n\n--posix\n     Instructs 'tar' to create a POSIX compliant 'tar' archive.\n\n--preserve\n     Synonymous with specifying both --preserve-permissions' and\n     --same-order.\n\n--preserve-order\n     (See --same-order; *note Reading::..)\n\n--preserve-permissions\n--same-permissions\n-p\n     When 'tar' is extracting an archive, it normally subtracts the\n     users' umask from the permissions specified in the archive and\n     uses that number as the permissions to create the destination\n     file.  Specifying this option instructs 'tar' that it should use\n     the permissions directly from the archive.  *Note Writing::.\n\n--read-full-records\n-B\n     Specifies that 'tar' should reblock its input, for reading from\n     pipes on systems with buggy implementations.  *Note Reading::.\n\n--record-size=<i>SIZE</i>\n     Instructs 'tar' to use SIZE bytes per record when accessing the\n     archive.\n\n--recursive-unlink\n     Similar to the --unlink-first option, removing existing\n     directory hierarchies before extracting directories of the same\n     name from the archive.  *Note Writing::.\n\n--remove-files\n     Directs 'tar' to remove the source file from the file system after\n     appending it to an archive.\n\n--rsh-command=<i>CMD</i>\n     Notifies 'tar' that is should use CMD to communicate with remote\n     devices.\n\n--same-order\n--preserve-order\n-s\n     This option is an optimization for 'tar' when running on machines\n     with small amounts of memory.  It informs 'tar' that the list of\n     file arguments has already been sorted to match the order of files\n     in the archive.  *Note Reading::.\n\n--same-owner\n     When extracting an archive, 'tar' will attempt to preserve the\n     owner specified in the 'tar' archive with this option present.\n\n--same-permissions\n     (See --preserve-permissions; *note Writing::..)\n\n--show-omitted-dirs\n     Instructs 'tar' to mention directories its skipping over when\n     operating on a 'tar' archive.\n\n--sparse\n-S\n     Invokes a GNU extension when adding files to an archive that\n     handles sparse files efficiently.\n\n--starting-file=<i>NAME</i>\n-K <i>NAME</i>\n     This option affects extraction only; 'tar' will skip extracting\n     files in the archive until it finds one that matches NAME.  *Note\n     Scarce::.\n\n--suffix=<i>SUFFIX</i>\n     Alters the suffix 'tar' uses when backing up files from the default\n     '~'.\n\n--tape-length=<i>NUM</i>\n-L <i>NUM</i>\n     Specifies the length of tapes that 'tar' is writing as being\n     NUM x 1024 bytes long.\n\n--to-stdout\n-O\n     During extraction, 'tar' will extract files to stdout rather than\n     to the file system.  *Note Writing::.\n\n--totals\n     Displays the total number of bytes written after creating an\n     archive.\n\n--touch\n-m\n     Sets the modification time of extracted files to the extraction\n     time, rather than the modification time stored in the archive.\n     *Note Writing::.\n\n--uncompress\n     (See --compress.)\n\n--ungzip\n     (See --gzip.)\n\n--unlink-first\n-U\n     Direct 'tar' to remove the corresponding file from the file system\n     before extracting it from the archive.  *Note Writing::.\n\n--use-compress-program=<i>PROG</i>\n     Instruct 'tar' to access the archive through <i>PROG</i>, which is\n     presumed to be a compression program of some sort.\n\n--verbose\n-v\n     Be more verbose about the operation.\n     This option can be specified multiple times (for some operations)\n     to increase the amount of information displayed.\n\n--verify\n-W\n     Verify that the archive was correctly written.\n\n--version\n     'tar' will print an informational message about what version it is\n     and a copyright message, some credits, and then exit.\n\n--volno-file=FILE\n     Used in conjunction with --multi-volume'.

Only UDP is allowed for unprivileged users. \n   -d    Enable socket level debugging (when the Linux kernel supports it) \n\n   -F    Set the \"Don't Fragment\" bit. This tells intermediate routers not to fragment\n         the packet when they find it's too big for a network hop's MTU. \n\n   -f <i>first_ttl</i>\n         With what TTL to start. Default = 1 \n\n   -g <i>gateway</i>\n         Adds an IP source route gateway to the outgoing packet. Not useful, as\n         most routers have disabled this for security reasons. \n\n   -i <i>interface</i>\n         The interface through which traceroute should send packets.\n         Default = select according to the routing table. \n\n   -m <i>max_ttl</i>\n         The max no. of hops (max time-to-live value) traceroute will probe. Default=30 hops\n\n   -N <i>squeries</i>\n         The number of probe packets sent out simultaneously. Sending several probes\n         concurrently can speed up traceroute considerably. Default = 16\n         Note that some routers and hosts can use ICMP rate throttling. In such a situation\n         specifying too large number can lead to loss of some responses. \n\n   -n    Show numerical addresses; do not look up hostnames.\n         (Useful if DNS is not functioning properly.)\n\n   -p <i>port</i>\n         For UDP tracing: the destination port base traceroute will use\n         (the destination port number will be incremented by each probe).\n         For ICMP tracing: the initial icmp sequence value (incremented by each probe).\n         For TCP tracing: the (constant) destination port to connect. \n   -t <i>tos</i>\n         For IPv4, set the Type of Service (TOS) and Precedence value.\n         Useful values are 16 (low delay) and 8 (high throughput).\n         Note that in order to use some TOS precendence values, you have to be super user.\n         For IPv6, set the Traffic Control value. \n\n   -w <i>waittime</i>\n         Set the time (in seconds) to wait for a response to a probe (default 5.0 sec). \n\n   -q <i>nqueries</i>\n         Set the number of probe packets per hop. Default = 3 \n\n   -r    Bypass the normal routing tables and send directly to a host on an attached network.\n         If the host is not on a directly-attached network, an error is returned.\n         This option can be used to ping a local host through an interface that has no route through it. \n\n   -s <i>source_addr</i>\n         Choose an alternative source address. You must select the address of one of the interfaces.\n         Default = address of the outgoing interface. \n\n   -z sendwait\n         Minimal time interval between probes (default 0). If the value is more than 10,\n         then it specifies a number in milliseconds, else it is a number of seconds\n        (float point values allowed too). Useful when some routers use rate-limit for icmp messages. \n\n   -A    Perform AS path lookups in routing registries and print results directly after\n         the corresponding addresses \n\n   -V    Print the version and exit.\n\n   --help  Print help info and exit. \n\n   -4, -6  Explicitly force IPv4 or IPv6 traceouting. By default, the program will try\n           to resolve the name given, and choose the appropriate protocol automatically.\n           If resolving a host name returns both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, traceroute will use IPv4.

      "Syntax\n      units <i>options</i> [<i>FROM-UNIT</i> [<i>TO-UNIT</i>]]\n\nOptions\n\n -c\n --check\n     Check that all units and prefixes defined in the units file reduce\n     to primitive units.  The program will print a list of all units\n     that cannot be reduced.\n\n --check-verbose\n     Like the '-check' option, this option prints a list of units that\n     cannot be reduced.  But to help find unit  definitions that cause\n     endless loops, it lists the units as they are checked.  If 'units'\n     hangs, then the last unit to be printed has a bad definition.\n\n -o <i>format</i>\n --output-format format\n     Use the specified format for numeric output.  Format is the same\n     as that for the printf function in the ANSI C standard.  For\n     example, if you want more precision you might use '-o %.15g'.\n\n -f <i>filename</i>\n --file <i>filename</i>\n     Use filename as the units data file rather than the default units\n     data file 'units.dat'.\n\n -h\n --help\n     Print out a summary of the options for 'units'.\n\n -q\n --quiet\n --silent\n     Suppress prompting of the user for units and the display of\n     statistics about the number of units loaded.\n\n -s\n --strict\n     Suppress conversion of units to their reciprocal units.\n\n -v\n --verbose\n     Give slightly more verbose output when converting units.  When\n     combined with the '-c' option this gives the same effect as\n     '--check-verbose'.\n\n -V\n --version\n     Print program version number, tell whether the readline library\n     has been included, and give the location of the default units data\n     file.",

Many shell archive scripts\n      (including those produced by 'shar' 3.40 and newer) accepts a '-c'\n      argument to indicate that existing files should be overwritten.\n\n      The option '-f' is provided for a more unique interface.  Many\n      programs (such as 'cp' and 'mv') use this option to trigger the\n      very same action.\n\n -e\n --exit-0\n      This option exists mainly for people who collect many shell\n      archives into a single mail folder.  With this option, 'unshar'\n      isolates each different shell archive from the others which have\n      been put in the same file, unpacking each in turn, from the\n      beginning of the file towards its end.  Its proper operation\n      relies on the fact that many shar files are terminated by a\n      'exit 0' at the beginning of a line.\n\n      Option '-e' is internally equivalent to '-E \"exit 0\"'.\n\n -E <i>STRING</i>\n --split-at=<i>STRING</i>\n      This option works like '-e', but it allows you to specify the\n      string that separates archives if 'exit 0' isn't appropriate.\n \n      For example, noticing that most '.signatures' have a '--' on a\n      line right before them, one can sometimes use '--split-at=--' for\n      splitting shell archives which lack the 'exit 0' line at end.  The\n      signature will then be skipped altogether with the headers of the\n      following message.\n\n --version\n      Print the version number of the program on standard output, then\n      immediately exits.\n\n --help\n      Print a help summary on standard output, then immediately exits."

It is generally a short description of the login, and is\n       currently used as the field for the user's full name. \n\n   -d, --home <i>HOME_DIR</i>\n       The new user will be created using HOME_DIR as the value for the user's\n       login directory.

A value of 0 disables the account as soon as the\n       password has expired, and a value of -1 disables the feature.\n\n       If not specified, useradd will use the default inactivity period\n       specified by the INACTIVE variable in /etc/default/useradd,\n       or -1 by default.\n\n   -g, --gid <i>GROUP</i>\n       The group name or number of the user's initial login group.\n       The group name must exist.\n       A group number must refer to an already existing group.\n\n       If not specified, the bahavior of useradd will depend on the\n       USERGROUPS_ENAB variable in /etc/login.defs. If this variable is\n       set to yes (or -U/--user-group is specified on the command line),\n       a group will be created for the user, with the same name as her\n       loginname.\n       If the variable is set to no (or -N/--no-user-group is specified\n       on the command line), useradd will set the primary group of the\n       new user to the value specified by the GROUP variable\n       in /etc/default/useradd, or 100 by default.\n\n   -G, --groups <i>GROUP1</i>[,<i>GROUP2</i>,...[,<i>GROUPN</i>]]]\n       A list of supplementary groups which the user is also a member of.\n       Each group is separated from the next by a comma, with no\n       intervening whitespace.

The default is to use the smallest\n       ID value greater than 999 and greater than every other user.\n       Values between 0 and 999 are typically reserved for system accounts.\n\n   -U, --user-group\n       Create a group with the same name as the user, and add the user to this group.\n   \n       The default behavior (if the -g, -N, and -U options are not specified)\n       is defined by the USERGROUPS_ENAB variable in /etc/login.defs.\n\n   -Z, --selinux-user <i>SEUSER</i>\n       The SELinux user for the user's login.\n       The default is to leave this field blank, which causes the system to\n       select the default SELinux user. \n\n   Changing the default values\n\n   When invoked with only the -D option, useradd will display the current\n   default values.

An  example  alias for which that is\n       using this feature is as follows:\n\n       alias which='alias | which --tty-only --read-alias --show-tilde --show-dot'\n\n       This will print the output of alias for  each  alias  that\n       matches  one  of  the given arguments.

A  self-extracting\n              executable  archive  is created by prepending the SFX stub to an\n              existing archive. The -A option tells zip to  adjust  the  entry\n              offsets  stored in the archive to take into account this \"pream-\n              ble\" data.\n\n       Note: self-extracting archives for the Amiga are a  special  case.   At\n       present, only the Amiga port of zip is capable of adjusting or updating\n       these without corrupting them. -J can be used to remove the SFX stub if\n       other updates need to be made.\n\n       -AC\n       --archive-clear\n              [WIN32]   Once  archive  is  created  (and tested if -T is used,\n              which is recommended), clear the  archive  bits  of  files  pro-\n              cessed.   WARNING:  Once  the bits are cleared they are cleared.\n              You might want to use the -sf show files option to store the  list\n              of  files  processed  in  case  the  archive  operation  must be\n              repeated.  Also consider using the -MM must  match  option.   Be\n              sure to check out -DF as a possibly better way to do incremental\n              backups.\n\n       -AS\n       --archive-set\n              [WIN32]  Only include files  that  have  the  archive  bit  set.\n              Directories  are  not stored when -AS is used, though by default\n              the paths of entries, including directories, are stored as usual\n              and can be used by most unzips to recreate directories.\n\n              The  archive  bit  is set by the operating system when a file is\n              modified and, if used with -AC, -AS can provide  an  incremental\n              backup  capability.   However, other applications can modify the\n              archive bit and it may not be  a  reliable  indicator  of  which\n              files  have  changed since the last archive operation.  Alterna-\n              tive ways to create incremental backups are using -t to use file\n              dates,  though  this won't catch old files copied to directories\n              being archived, and -DF to create a differential archive.\n\n       -B\n       --binary\n              [VM/CMS and MVS] force file to be read binary (default is text).\n\n       -Bn    [TANDEM] set Edit/Enscribe formatting options with n defined as\n              bit  0: Don't add delimiter (Edit/Enscribe)\n              bit  1: Use LF rather than CR/LF as delimiter (Edit/Enscribe)\n              bit  2: Space fill record to maximum record length (Enscribe)\n              bit  3: Trim trailing space (Enscribe)\n              bit  8: Force 30K (Expand) large read for unstructured files\n\n       -b <i>path</i>\n       --temp-path <i>path</i>\n              Use  the specified path for the temporary zip archive. For exam-\n              ple:\n\n                     zip -b /tmp stuff *\n\n              will put the temporary zip archive in the directory /tmp,  copy-\n              ing  over  stuff.zip  to  the  current directory when done. This\n              option is useful when updating an existing archive and the  file\n              system containing this old archive does not have enough space to\n              hold both old and new archives at the same time.  It can also be\n              useful  when  streaming in some cases to avoid the need for data\n              descriptors.  Note that using this option can require zip to take\n              additional time to copy the archive file when done to the\n              destination file system.\n\n       -c\n       --entry-comments\n              Add one-line comments for each file.  File  operations  (adding,\n              updating)  are  done  first, and the user is then prompted for a\n              one-line comment for each file.  Enter the comment  followed  by\n              return, or just return for no comment.\n\n       -C\n       --preserve-case\n              [VMS]   Preserve  case  all  on VMS.  Negating this option (-C-)\n              downcases.\n\n       -C2\n       --preserve-case-2\n              [VMS]  Preserve case ODS2 on VMS.

Negating this option (-C5-)\n              downcases.\n\n       -d\n       --delete\n              Remove (delete) entries from a zip archive.  For example:\n\n                     zip -d foo foo/tom/junk foo/harry/\\* \\*.o\n\n              will remove the entry foo/tom/junk, all of the files that  start\n              with  foo/harry/,  and all of the files that end with .o (in any\n              path).  Note that shell pathname expansion  has  been  inhibited\n              with  backslashes,  so  that zip can see the asterisks, enabling\n              zip to match on the contents of the zip archive instead  of  the\n              contents  of  the  current  directory.  (The backslashes are not\n              used on MSDOS-based platforms.)  Can also use quotes  to  escape\n              the asterisks as in\n\n                     zip -d foo foo/tom/junk \"foo/harry/*\" \"*.o\"\n\n              Not  escaping  the asterisks on a system where the shell expands\n              wildcards could result in the asterisks  being  converted  to  a\n              list  of  files  in  the current directory and that list used to\n              delete entries from the archive.\n\n              Under MSDOS, -d is case sensitive when it matches names  in  the\n              zip  archive.  This requires that file names be entered in upper\n              case if they were zipped by PKZIP on an MSDOS system.  (We  con-\n              sidered making this case insensitive on systems where paths were\n              case insensitive, but it is possible the  archive  came  from  a\n              system where case does matter and the archive could include both\n              Bar and bar as separate files in the archive.)  But see the  new\n              option -ic to ignore case in the archive.\n\n       -db\n       --display-bytes\n              Display  running  byte  counts  showing the bytes zipped and the\n              bytes to go.\n\n       -dc\n       --display-counts\n              Display running count of entries zipped and entries to go.\n\n       -dd\n       --display-dots\n              Display dots while each entry is zipped (except  on  ports  that\n              have  their  own progress indicator).  See -ds below for setting\n              dot size.  The default is a dot every 10 MB of input  file  pro-\n              cessed.   The -v option also displays dots (previously at a much\n              higher rate than this but now -v also defaults  to  10  MB)  and\n              this rate is also controlled by -ds.\n\n       -df\n       --datafork\n              [MacOS] Include only data-fork of files zipped into the archive.\n              Good  for  exporting   files   to   foreign   operating-systems.\n              Resource-forks will be ignored at all.\n\n       -dg\n       --display-globaldots\n              Display  progress dots for the archive instead of for each file.\n              The command\n\n                         zip -qdgds 10m\n\n              will turn off most output except dots every 10 MB.\n\n       -ds size\n       --dot-size size\n              Set amount of input file processed for each dot displayed.   See\n              -dd to enable displaying dots.  Setting this option implies -dd.\n              Size is in the format nm where n is a number and m is  a  multi-\n              plier.  Currently m can be k (KB), m (MB), g (GB), or t (TB), so\n              if n is 100 and m is k, size would be 100k which is 100 KB.  The\n              default is 10 MB.\n\n              The -v option also displays dots and now defaults to 10 MB also.\n              This rate is also controlled by this option.  A size of 0  turns\n              dots off.\n\n              This  option does not control the dots from the \"Scanning files\"\n              message as zip scans for input files.  The dot size for that  is\n              fixed  at  2  seconds or a fixed number of entries, whichever is\n              longer.\n\n       -du\n       --display-usize\n              Display the uncompressed size of each entry.\n\n       -dv\n       --display-volume\n              Display the volume (disk) number each entry is being read  from,\n              if reading an existing archive, and being written to.\n\n       -D\n       --no-dir-entries\n              Do  not  create  entries  in  the  zip  archive for directories.\n              Directory  entries  are  created  by  default  so   that   their\n              attributes  can  be  saved  in the zip archive.  The environment\n              variable ZIPOPT can be used to change the default  options.  For\n              example under Unix with sh:\n\n                     ZIPOPT=\"-D\"; export ZIPOPT\n\n              (The  variable  ZIPOPT  can be used for any option, including -i\n              and -x using a new option format detailed below, and can include\n              several  options.)  The option -D is a shorthand for -x \"*/\" but\n              the latter previously could not be set as default in the  ZIPOPT\n              environment  variable  as  the  contents of ZIPOPT gets inserted\n              near the beginning of the command line and the file list had  to\n              end at the end of the line.\n\n              This  version  of  zip does allow -x and -i options in ZIPOPT if\n              the form\n\n               -x file file ... @\n\n              is used, where the @ (an argument that is just @) terminates the\n              list.\n\n       -DF\n       --difference-archive\n              Create  an archive that contains all new and changed files since\n              the original archive was created.  For this to work,  the  input\n              file  list  and current directory must be the same as during the\n              original zip operation.\n\n              For example, if the existing archive was created using\n\n                     zip -r foofull .\n\n              from the bar directory, then the command\n\n                     zip -r foofull . -DF --out foonew\n\n              also from the bar directory creates the archive foonew with just\n              the  files  not  in foofull and the files where the size or file\n              time of the files do not match those in foofull.\n\n              Note that the timezone environment variable  TZ  should  be  set\n              according to the local timezone in order for this option to work\n              correctly.  A change in timezone since the original archive  was\n              created  could  result  in no times matching and all files being\n              included.\n\n              A possible approach to backing up a directory might be to create\n              a  normal  archive  of  the  contents of the directory as a full\n              backup, then use this option to create incremental backups.\n\n       -e\n       --encrypt\n              Encrypt the contents of the zip archive using a  password  which\n              is  entered  on  the terminal in response to a prompt (this will\n              not be echoed; if standard error is not a  tty,  zip  will  exit\n              with  an  error).

For example:\n\n                     zip -f foo\n\n              This command should be run from the same  directory  from  which\n              the  original zip command was run, since paths stored in zip ar-\n              chives are always relative.\n\n              Note that the timezone environment variable  TZ  should  be  set\n              according  to  the local timezone in order for the -f, -u and -o\n              options to work correctly.\n\n              The reasons behind this are somewhat subtle but have to do  with\n              the  differences  between  the Unix-format file times (always in\n              GMT) and most of the other operating systems (always local time)\n              and  the  necessity  to  compare the two.  A typical TZ value is\n              ''MET-1MEST'' (Middle European time  with  automatic  adjustment\n              for ''summertime'' or Daylight Savings Time).\n\n              The  format is TTThhDDD, where TTT is the time zone such as MET,\n              hh is the difference between GMT  and  local  time  such  as  -1\n              above, and DDD is the time zone when daylight savings time is in\n              effect.  Leave off the DDD if there is no daylight savings time.\n              For the US Eastern time zone EST5EDT.\n\n       -F\n       --fix\n       -FF\n       --fixfix\n              Fix  the zip archive. The -F option can be used if some portions\n              of the archive are missing, but  requires  a  reasonably  intact\n              central  directory.   The input archive is scanned as usual, but\n              zip will ignore some problems.  The resulting archive should  be\n              valid, but any inconsistent entries will be left out.\n\n              When  doubled  as in -FF, the archive is scanned from the begin-\n              ning and zip scans for special signatures to identify the limits\n              between  the  archive members. The single -F is more reliable if\n              the archive is not too much damaged, so try this option first.\n\n              If the archive is too damaged or the end has been truncated, you\n              must  use  -FF.   This  is  a change from zip 2.32, where the -F\n              option is able to read a truncated archive.  The -F  option  now\n              more  reliably  fixes  archives  with  minor  damage and the -FF\n              option is needed to fix archives where -F might have been suffi-\n              cient before.\n\n              Neither  option will recover archives that have been incorrectly\n              transferred in ascii mode instead of binary. After  the  repair,\n              the  -t option of unzip might show that some files have a bad CRC.\n              Such files cannot be recovered; you can remove them from the ar-\n              chive using the -d option of zip.\n\n              Note  that  -FF can have trouble fixing archives that include an\n              embedded zip archive that was stored  (without  compression)  in\n              the  archive  and,  depending  on  the  damage,  it can find the\n              entries in the embedded archive rather than the archive  itself.\n              Try -F first as it does not have this problem.\n\n              The  format  of  the fix commands have changed.  For example, to\n              fix the damaged archive foo.zip,\n\n                     zip -F foo --out foofix\n\n              tries to read the entries normally, copying good entries to  the\n              new  archive  foofix.zip.  If this doesn't work, as when the ar-\n              chive is truncated, or if some entries you know are in  the  ar-\n              chive are missed, then try\n\n                     zip -FF foo --out foofixfix\n\n              and  compare the resulting archive to the archive created by -F.\n              The -FF option can create an inconsistent archive.  Depending on\n              what  is damaged, you can then use the -F option to fix that ar-\n              chive.\n\n              A split archive with missing split files can be fixed  using  -F\n              if  you  have the last split of the archive (the .zip file).  If\n              this file is missing, you must use -FF to fix the archive, which\n              will prompt you for the splits you have.\n\n              Currently  the fix options can't recover entries that have a bad\n              checksum or are otherwise damaged.\n\n       -FI\n       --fifo [Unix]  Normally zip  skips  reading  any  FIFOs  (named  pipes)\n              encountered, as zip can hang if the FIFO is not being fed.  This\n              option tells zip to read the contents of any FIFO it finds.\n\n       -FS\n       --filesync\n              Synchronize the contents of an archive with the files on the OS.\n              Normally  when  an  archive  is updated, new files are added and\n              changed files are updated but files that no longer exist on  the\n              OS  are not deleted from the archive.  This option enables a new\n              mode that checks entries in the archive against the file system.\n              If  the file time and file size of the entry matches that of the\n              OS file, the entry is copied from the  old  archive  instead  of\n              being  read from the file system and compressed.  If the OS file\n              has changed, the entry is read and compressed as usual.  If  the\n              entry  in the archive does not match a file on the OS, the entry\n              is deleted.  Enabling this option should  create  archives  that\n              are  the  same  as  new archives, but since existing entries are\n              copied instead of compressed, updating an existing archive  with\n              -FS  can  be much faster than creating a new archive.  Also con-\n              sider using -u for updating an archive.\n\n              For this option to work, the archive should be updated from  the\n              same  directory  it  was created in so the relative paths match.\n              If few files are being copied from the old archive,  it  can  be\n              faster to create a new archive instead.\n\n              Note  that  the  timezone  environment variable TZ should be set\n              according to the local timezone in order for this option to work\n              correctly.   A change in timezone since the original archive was\n              created could result in no times matching and  recompression  of\n              all files.\n\n              This option deletes files from the archive.  If you need to pre-\n              serve the original archive, make a copy of the archive first  or\n              use  the  --out  option  to  output the updated archive to a new\n              file.  Even though it might be slower, creating a new archive with\n              a  new  archive name is safer, avoids mismatches between archive\n              and OS paths, and is preferred.\n\n       -g\n       --grow\n              Grow (append to) the specified zip archive, instead of  creating\n              a  new one. If this operation fails, zip attempts to restore the\n              archive to its original state. If the restoration fails, the ar-\n              chive  might  become  corrupted.  This  option  is  ignored when\n              there's no existing archive or when at least one archive  member\n              must be updated or deleted.\n\n       -h\n       -?\n       --help\n              Display  the  zip  help information (this also appears if zip is\n              run with no arguments).\n\n       -h2\n       --more-help\n              Display extended help including more  on  command  line  format,\n              pattern matching, and more obscure options.\n\n       -i <i>files</i>\n       --include <i>files</i>\n              Include only the specified files, as in:\n\n                     zip -r foo . -i \\*.c\n\n              which  will include only the files that end in .c in the current\n              directory and its subdirectories. (Note  for  PKZIP  users:  the\n              equivalent command is\n\n                     pkzip -rP foo *.c\n\n              PKZIP  does  not  allow  recursion in directories other than the\n              current one.)  The backslash avoids the shell filename substitu-\n              tion,  so  that  the  name  matching  is performed by zip at all\n              directory levels.  [This is for Unix and other systems  where  \\\n              escapes  the  next character.  For other systems where the shell\n              does not process * do not use \\ and the above is\n\n                     zip -r foo . -i *.c\n\n              Examples are  for  Unix  unless  otherwise  specified.]   So  to\n              include  dir,  a directory directly under the current directory,\n              use\n\n                     zip -r foo . -i dir/\\*\n\n              or\n\n                     zip -r foo . -i \"dir/*\"\n\n              to match paths such as dir/a and dir/b/file.c [on ports  without\n              wildcard expansion in the shell such as MSDOS and Windows\n\n                     zip -r foo . -i dir/*\n\n              is  used.]   Note  that  currently  the trailing / is needed for\n              directories (as in\n\n                     zip -r foo . -i dir/\n\n              to include directory dir).\n\n              The long option form of the first example is\n\n                     zip -r foo . --include \\*.c\n\n              and does the same thing as the short option form.\n\n              Though the command syntax used to require -i at the end  of  the\n              command  line,  this  version  actually allows -i (or --include)\n              anywhere.  The list of files terminates  at  the  next  argument\n              starting with -, the end of the command line, or the list termi-\n              nator @ (an argument that is just @).  So the above can be given\n              as\n\n                     zip -i \\*.c @ -r foo .\n\n              for  example.   There must be a space between the option and the\n              first file of a list.  For just one file you can use the  single\n              value form\n\n                     zip -i\\*.c -r foo .\n\n              (no space between option and value) or\n\n                     zip --include=\\*.c -r foo .\n\n              as  additional  examples.  The single value forms are not recom-\n              mended because they can be confusing  and,  in  particular,  the\n              -ifile  format  can  cause  problems if the first letter of file\n              combines with i to form a two-letter  option  starting  with  i.\n              Use -sc to see how your command line will be parsed.\n\n              Also possible:\n\n                     zip -r foo  . -i@include.lst\n\n              which  will  only include the files in the current directory and\n              its  subdirectories  that  match  the  patterns  in   the   file\n              include.lst.\n\n              Files to -i and -x are patterns matching internal archive paths.\n              See -R for more on patterns.\n\n       -I\n       --no-image\n              [Acorn RISC OS] Don't scan through Image files.  When used,  zip\n              will  not  consider Image files (eg. DOS partitions or Spark ar-\n              chives when SparkFS is loaded) as  directories  but  will  store\n              them as single files.\n\n              For example, if you have SparkFS loaded, zipping a Spark archive\n              will result in a zipfile containing a directory  (and  its  con-\n              tent)  while  using the 'I' option will result in a zipfile con-\n              taining a Spark archive. Obviously this second case will also be\n              obtained (without the 'I' option) if SparkFS isn't loaded.\n\n       -ic\n       --ignore-case\n              [VMS,  WIN32]  Ignore  case when matching archive entries.  This\n              option is only available on systems where the case of  files  is\n              ignored.  On systems with case-insensitive file systems, case is\n              normally ignored when matching files on the file system  but  is\n              not  ignored for -f (freshen), -d (delete), -U (copy), and simi-\n              lar modes when matching against archive  entries  (currently  -f\n              ignores case on VMS) because archive entries can be from systems\n              where case does matter and names that are the  same  except  for\n              case can exist in an archive.  The -ic option makes all matching\n              case insensitive.  This can result in multiple  archive  entries\n              matching a command line pattern.\n\n       -j\n       --junk-paths\n              Store  just the name of a saved file (junk the path), and do not\n              store directory names.

This option should not be used on  binary  files.\n              This  option can be used on Unix if the zip file is intended for\n              PKUNZIP under MSDOS. If the input files already contain  CR  LF,\n              this option adds an extra CR. This is to ensure that unzip -a on\n              Unix will get back an exact copy of the original file,  to  undo\n              the effect of zip -l.  See -ll for how binary files are handled.\n\n       -la\n       --log-append\n              Append to existing logfile.  Default is to overwrite.\n\n       -lf logfilepath\n       --logfile-path logfilepath\n              Open a logfile at the given path.  By default any existing  file\n              at  that location is overwritten, but the -la option will result\n              in an existing file being opened and  the  new  log  information\n              appended  to any existing information.  Only warnings and errors\n              are written to the log unless the -li option is also given, then\n              all information messages are also written to the log.\n\n       -li\n       --log-info\n              Include  information  messages, such as file names being zipped,\n              in the log.  The default is to only include  the  command  line,\n              any warnings and errors, and the final status.\n\n       -ll\n       --from-crlf\n              Translate the MSDOS end-of-line CR LF into Unix LF.  This option\n              should not be used on binary files.  This option can be used  on\n              MSDOS  if the zip file is intended for unzip under Unix.  If the\n              file is converted and the file is later determined to be  binary\n              a warning is issued and the file is probably corrupted.  In this\n              release if -ll detects binary in the first buffer  read  from  a\n              file,  zip now issues a warning and skips line end conversion on\n              the file.  This check seems to catch all  binary  files  tested,\n              but  the original check remains and if a converted file is later\n              determined to be binary that warning is  still  issued.   A  new\n              algorithm  is  now  being  used for binary detection that should\n              allow line end conversion of text files  in  UTF-8  and  similar\n              encodings.\n\n       -L\n       --license\n              Display the zip license.\n\n       -m\n       --move\n              Move  the  specified  files into the zip archive; actually, this\n              deletes the target directories/files after making the  specified\n              zip  archive.  If a directory becomes empty after removal of the\n              files, the directory is also  removed.  No  deletions  are  done\n              until zip has created the archive without error.  This is useful\n              for conserving disk space, but is potentially dangerous so it is\n              recommended to use it in combination with -T to test the archive\n              before removing all input files.\n\n       -MM\n       --must-match\n              All input patterns must match at least one file  and  all  input\n              files  found  must  be readable.  Normally when an input pattern\n              does not match a file the \"name not matched\" warning  is  issued\n              and  when  an  input file has been found but later is missing or\n              not readable a missing or not readable warning  is  issued.   In\n              either  case zip continues creating the archive, with missing or\n              unreadable new files being skipped and files already in the  ar-\n              chive remaining unchanged.  After the archive is created, if any\n              files were not readable zip returns the OPEN error code  (18  on\n              most  systems)  instead  of the normal success return (0 on most\n              systems).  With -MM set, zip exits as soon as an  input  pattern\n              is not matched (whenever the \"name not matched\" warning would be\n              issued) or when an input file is not readable.  In  either  case\n              zip exits with an OPEN error and no archive is created.\n\n              This option is useful when a known list of files is to be zipped\n              so any missing or unreadable files will result in an error.   It\n              is less useful when used with wildcards, but zip will still exit\n              with an error if any input pattern doesn't match  at  least  one\n              file  and  if  any matched files are unreadable.  If you want to\n              create the archive anyway and only need to know  if  files  were\n              skipped, don't use -MM and just check the return code.  Also -lf\n              could be useful.\n\n       -n suffixes\n       --suffixes suffixes\n              Do not attempt to compress files named with the given  suffixes.\n              Such files are stored (0% compression) in the output zip file,\n              so that zip doesn't waste  its  time  trying  to  compress them.\n              The  suffixes  are  separated  by either colons or semi- colons.\n              For example:\n\n                   zip -rn .Z:.zip:.tiff:.gif:.snd  foo foo\n\n              will copy everything from foo into foo.zip, but will  store  any\n              files  that end in .Z, .zip, .tiff, .gif, or .snd without trying\n              to compress them (image and sound files  often  have  their  own\n              specialized compression methods).  By default, zip does not com-\n              press     files     with     extensions     in     the      list\n              .Z:.zip:.zoo:.arc:.lzh:.arj.   Such files are stored directly in\n              the output archive.  The environment variable ZIPOPT can be used\n              to change the default options. For example under Unix with csh:\n\n                   setenv ZIPOPT \"-n .gif:.zip\"\n\n              To attempt compression on all files, use:\n\n                   zip -n : foo\n\n              The maximum  compression option -9 also attempts compression on\n              all files regardless of extension.\n\n              On Acorn RISC OS systems the suffixes are actually filetypes  (3\n              hex  digit format). By default, zip does not compress files with\n              filetypes in the list DDC:D96:68E (i.e. Archives, CFS files  and\n              PackDir files).\n\n       -nw\n       --no-wild\n              Do not perform internal wildcard processing (shell processing of\n              wildcards is still done by the shell unless  the  arguments  are\n              escaped).   Useful if a list of paths is being read and no wild-\n              card substitution is desired.\n\n       -N\n       --notes\n              [Amiga, MacOS] Save Amiga or MacOS  filenotes  as  zipfile  com-\n              ments.  They can be restored by using the -N option of unzip. If\n              -c is used also, you are prompted for comments  only  for  those\n              files that do not have filenotes.\n\n       -o\n       --latest-time\n              Set  the  \"last  modified\" time of the zip archive to the latest\n              (oldest) \"last modified\" time found among the entries in the zip\n              archive. This  can  be  used  without any other operations, if\n              desired. For example:\n\n              zip -o foo\n\n              will change the last modified time of foo.zip to the latest time\n              of the entries in foo.zip.\n\n       -O output-file\n       --output-file output-file\n              Process  the  archive  changes as usual, but instead of updating\n              the existing archive, output the  new  archive  to  output-file.\n              Useful for updating an archive without changing the existing ar-\n              chive and the input archive must be a different  file  than  the\n              output archive.\n\n              This  option  can  be used to create updated split archives.  It\n              can also be used with -U to copy entries from  an  existing  ar-\n              chive to a new archive.  See the EXAMPLES section below.\n\n              Another  use  is  converting  zip  files  from one split size to\n              another.  For instance, to convert an archive  with  700  MB  CD\n              splits to one with 2 GB DVD splits, can use:\n\n                     zip -s 2g cd-split.zip --out dvd-split.zip\n\n              which uses copy mode.  See -U below.  Also:\n\n                     zip -s 0 split.zip --out unsplit.zip\n\n              will convert a split archive to a single-file archive.\n\n              Copy  mode  will  convert stream entries (using data descriptors\n              and which should be  compatible  with  most  unzips)  to  normal\n              entries  (which should be compatible with all unzips), except if\n              standard encryption  was  used.   For  archives  with  encrypted\n              entries,  zipcloak  will decrypt the entries and convert them to\n              normal entries.\n\n       -p\n       --paths\n              Include relative file paths as part of the names of files stored\n              in  the  archive.  This is the default.  The -j option junks the\n              paths and just stores the names of the files.\n\n       -P password\n       --password password\n              Use password to encrypt zipfile entries (if any).  THIS IS INSE-\n              CURE!   Many  multi-user  operating systems provide ways for any\n              user to see the current command line of any other user; even  on\n              stand-alone  systems  there  is  always  the threat of over-the-\n              shoulder peeking.  Storing the plaintext password as part  of  a\n              command  line  in  an  automated script is even worse.  Whenever\n              possible, use the non-echoing, interactive prompt to enter pass-\n              words.   (And  where  security  is  truly  important, use strong\n              encryption such as Pretty Good Privacy instead of the relatively\n              weak standard encryption provided by zipfile utilities.)\n\n       -q\n       --quiet\n              Quiet   mode;   eliminate  informational  messages  and  comment\n              prompts.  (Useful, for example, in shell scripts and  background\n              tasks).\n\n       -Qn\n       --Q-flag n\n              [QDOS]  store information about the file in the file header with\n              n defined as\n              bit  0: Don't add headers for any file\n              bit  1: Add headers for all files\n              bit  2: Don't wait for interactive key press on exit\n\n       -r\n       --recurse-paths\n              Travel the directory structure recursively; for example:\n\n                     zip -r foo.zip foo\n\n              or more concisely\n\n                     zip -r foo foo\n\n              In this case, all the files and directories in foo are saved  in\n              a zip archive named foo.zip, including files with names starting\n              with \".\", since the recursion does not use the shell's file-name\n              substitution  mechanism.  If you wish to include only a specific\n              subset of the files in directory foo and its subdirectories, use\n              the  -i  option  to specify the pattern of files to be included.\n              You should not use -r with the name  \".*\",  since  that  matches\n              \"..\"   which will attempt to zip up the parent directory (proba-\n              bly not what was intended).\n\n              Multiple source directories are allowed as in\n\n                     zip -r foo foo1 foo2\n\n              which first zips up foo1 and then foo2, going down  each  direc-\n              tory.\n\n              Note  that  while  wildcards  to -r are typically resolved while\n              recursing down directories in the file system, any -R,  -x,  and\n              -i  wildcards are applied to internal archive pathnames once the\n              directories are scanned.  To have wildcards apply  to  files  in\n              subdirectories  when recursing on Unix and similar systems where\n              the shell does wildcard substitution, either  escape  all  wild-\n              cards  or put all arguments with wildcards in quotes.  This lets\n              zip see the wildcards and match files  in  subdirectories  using\n              them as it recurses.\n\n       -R\n       --recurse-patterns\n              Travel  the directory structure recursively starting at the cur-\n              rent directory; for example:\n\n                     zip -R foo \"*.c\"\n\n              In this case, all the files matching *.c in the tree starting at\n              the  current  directory  are  stored  into  a  zip archive named\n              foo.zip.  Note that *.c will match file.c, a/file.c and  a/b/.c.\n              More than one pattern can be listed as separate arguments.  Note\n              for PKZIP users: the equivalent command is\n\n                     pkzip -rP foo *.c\n\n              Patterns are relative file paths as they appear in the  archive,\n              or  will after zipping, and can have optional wildcards in them.\n              For example, given the current directory is foo and under it are\n              directories foo1 and foo2 and in foo1 is the file bar.c,\n\n                     zip -R foo/*\n\n              will zip up foo, foo/foo1, foo/foo1/bar.c, and foo/foo2.\n\n                     zip -R */bar.c\n\n              will  zip  up  foo/foo1/bar.c.   See the note for -r on escaping\n              wildcards.\n\n\n       -RE\n       --regex\n              [WIN32]  Before zip 3.0, regular expression  list  matching  was\n              enabled  by  default on Windows platforms.  Because of confusion\n              resulting from the need to escape \"[\" and \"]\" in  names,  it  is\n              now  off  by  default for Windows so \"[\" and \"]\" are just normal\n              characters in names.  This option enables [] matching again.\n\n\n       -s <i>splitsize</i>\n       --split-size <i>splitsize</i>\n              Enable creating a split archive and set the split size.  A split\n              archive  is  an archive that could be split over many files.  As\n              the archive is created, if the size of the archive  reaches  the\n              specified  split  size,  that split is closed and the next split\n              opened.  In general all splits but the last will  be  the  split\n              size  and  the last will be whatever is left.  If the entire ar-\n              chive is smaller than the split size a  single-file  archive  is\n              created.\n\n              Split  archives  are  stored in numbered files.  For example, if\n              the output  archive  is  named  archive  and  three  splits  are\n              required,  the  resulting archive will be in the three files ar-\n              chive.z01, archive.z02, and archive.zip.  Do not change the num-\n              bering  of  these  files  or the archive will not be readable as\n              these are used to determine the order the splits are read.\n\n              Split size is a number  optionally  followed  by  a  multiplier.\n              Currently  the  number  must  be an integer.  The multiplier can\n              currently be one of k (kilobytes), m (megabytes), g (gigabytes),\n              or  t  (terabytes).   As  64k is the minimum split size, numbers\n              without multipliers default to megabytes.  For example, to  cre-\n              ate  a  split  archive  called  foo with the contents of the bar\n              directory with splits of 670 MB that might be useful for burning\n              on CDs, the command:\n\n                     zip -s 670m -r foo bar\n\n              could be used.\n\n              Currently  the  old  splits  of a split archive are not excluded\n              from a new archive, but they can be specifically  excluded.   If\n              possible,  keep  the  input  and output archives out of the path\n              being zipped when creating split archives.\n\n              Using -s without -sp as above creates all the splits  where  foo\n              is  being  written,  in  this  case the current directory.  This\n              split mode updates the splits as the archive is  being  created,\n              requiring  all  splits to remain writable, but creates split ar-\n              chives that are readable by any unzip that  supports  split  ar-\n              chives.   See  -sp  below  for  enabling  split pause mode which\n              allows splits to be written directly to removable media.\n\n              The option -sv can be used to enable verbose splitting and  pro-\n              vide details of how the splitting is being done.  The -sb option\n              can be used to ring the bell when zip pauses for the next  split\n              destination.\n\n              Split  archives cannot be updated, but see the -O (--out) option\n              for how a split archive can be updated as it is copied to a  new\n              archive.   A  split archive can also be converted into a single-\n              file archive using a split size of 0 or negating the -s option:\n\n                     zip -s 0 split.zip --out single.zip\n\n              Also see -U (--copy) for more on using copy mode.\n\n       -sb\n       --split-bell\n              If splitting and using split pause mode, ring the bell when  zip\n              pauses for each split destination.\n\n       -sc\n       --show-command\n              Show  the  command line starting zip as processed and exit.  The\n              new command parser permutes the arguments, putting  all  options\n              and  any values associated with them before any non-option argu-\n              ments.  This allows an option to appear anywhere in the  command\n              line  as  long as any values that go with the option go with it.\n              This option displays the command line as zip sees it,  including\n              any arguments from the environment such as from the ZIPOPT vari-\n              able.  Where allowed, options later  in  the  command  line  can\n              override options earlier in the command line.\n\n       -sf\n       --show-files\n              Show  the  files  that  would  be  operated  on, then exit.  For\n              instance, if creating a new archive, this will  list  the  files\n              that  would  be  added.   If the option is negated, -sf-, output\n              only to an open log file.  Screen display is not recommended for\n              large lists.\n\n       -so\n       --show-options\n              Show  all  available options supported by zip as compiled on the\n              current system.  As this command  reads  the  option  table,  it\n              should include all options.  Each line includes the short option\n              (if defined), the long option (if defined), the  format  of  any\n              value  that  goes with the option, if the option can be negated,\n              and a small description.  The value  format  can  be  no  value,\n              required  value,  optional value, single character value, number\n              value, or a list of values.  The output of this  option  is  not\n              intended  to  show  how  to  use  any  option but only show what\n              options are available.\n\n       -sp\n       --split-pause\n              If splitting is enabled with -s, enable split pause mode.   This\n              creates split archives as -s does, but stream writing is used so\n              each split can be closed as soon as it is written and  zip  will\n              pause  between each split to allow changing split destination or\n              media.\n\n              Though this split mode allows writing splits directly to  remov-\n              able  media, it uses stream archive format that might not be read-\n              able by some unzips.  Before relying on splits created with -sp,\n              test a split archive with the unzip you will be using.\n\n              To  convert a stream split archive (created with -sp) to a stan-\n              dard archive see the --out option.\n\n       -su\n       --show-unicode\n              As -sf, but also show Unicode version of the path if exists.\n\n       -sU\n       --show-just-unicode\n              As -sf, but only show Unicode version of  the  path  if  exists,\n              otherwise show the standard version of the path.\n\n       -sv\n       --split-verbose\n              Enable various verbose messages while splitting, showing how the\n              splitting is being done.\n\n       -S\n       --system-hidden\n              [MSDOS, OS/2, WIN32 and ATARI] Include system and hidden  files.\n              [MacOS]  Includes finder invisible files, which are ignored oth-\n              erwise.\n\n       -t <i>mmddyyyy</i>\n       --from-date <i>mmddyyyy</i>\n              Do not operate on files modified prior to  the  specified  date,\n              where  mm  is  the  month  (00-12),  dd  is the day of the month\n              (01-31), and  yyyy  is  the  year.

On Unix, to use a copy of unzip in the\n              current directory instead of the standard  system  unzip,  could\n              use:\n\n               zip archive file1 file2 -T -TT \"./unzip -tqq\"\n\n              In  cmd,  {}  is  replaced by the name of the temporary archive,\n              otherwise the name of the archive is appended to the end of  the\n              command.  The return code is checked for success (0 on Unix).\n\n       -u\n       --update\n              Replace (update) an existing entry in the zip archive only if it\n              has been modified more recently than the version already in  the\n              zip archive.  For example:\n\n                     zip -u stuff *\n\n              will  add any new files in the current directory, and update any\n              files which have been modified since the zip  archive  stuff.zip\n              was  last  created/modified  (note that zip will not try to pack\n              stuff.zip into itself when you do this).\n\n              Note that the -u option with no input file arguments  acts  like\n              the -f (freshen) option.\n\n       -U\n       --copy-entries\n              Copy  entries  from  one archive to another.  Requires the --out\n              option to specify a different output file  than  the  input  ar-\n              chive.   Copy  mode is the reverse of -d delete.  When delete is\n              being used with --out, the selected entries are deleted from the\n              archive  and  all  other  entries are copied to the new archive,\n              while copy mode selects the files to include in the new archive.\n              Unlike -u update, input patterns on the command line are matched\n              against archive entries only and not the file system files.  For\n              instance,\n\n                     zip inarchive \"*.c\" --copy --out outarchive\n\n              copies  entries  with  names ending in .c from inarchive to out-\n              archive.  The wildcard must be escaped on some systems  to  pre-\n              vent  the  shell  from substituting names of files from the file\n              system which can have no relevance to the  entries  in  the  ar-\n              chive.\n\n              If  no input files appear on the command line and --out is used,\n              copy mode is assumed:\n\n                     zip inarchive --out outarchive\n\n              This is useful for changing split size for instance.  Encrypting\n              and  decrypting  entries  is  not yet supported using copy mode.\n              Use zipcloak for that.\n\n       -UN <i>v</i>\n       --unicode <i>v</i>\n              Determine what zip should do with Unicode file names.   zip 3.0,\n              in  addition  to  the standard file path, now includes the UTF-8\n              translation of the path if the entry path is not entirely  7-bit\n              ASCII.   When  an entry is missing the Unicode path, zip reverts\n              back to the standard file path.   The  problem  with  using  the\n              standard  path is this path is in the local character set of the\n              zip that created the entry, which can  contain  characters  that\n              are  not  valid  in  the  character set being used by the unzip.\n              When zip is reading an archive, if an entry also has  a  Unicode\n              path, zip now defaults to using the Unicode path to recreate the\n              standard path using the current local character set.\n\n              This option can be used to determine what  zip  should  do  with\n              this  path  if  there  is a mismatch between the stored standard\n              path and the stored UTF-8 path (which can happen if the standard\n              path  was  updated).  In all cases, if there is a mismatch it is\n              assumed that the standard path is  more  current  and  zip  uses\n              that.  Values for <i>v</i> are:\n\n                     q - quit if paths do not match\n\n                     w - warn, continue with standard path\n\n                     i - ignore, continue with standard path\n\n                     n - no Unicode, do not use Unicode paths\n\n              The default is to warn and continue.\n\n              Characters  that  are not valid in the current character set are\n              escaped as #Uxxxx and #Lxxxxxx, where x is  an  ASCII  character\n              for a hex digit.  The first is used if a 16-bit character number\n              is sufficient to represent the Unicode character and the  second\n              if  the character needs more than 16 bits to represent it's Uni-\n              code character code.  Setting -UN to\n\n                     e - escape\n\n              as in\n\n                     zip archive -sU -UN=e\n\n              forces zip to escape all characters that are not printable 7-bit\n              ASCII.\n\n              Normally zip stores UTF-8 directly in the standard path field on\n              systems where UTF-8 is the current character set and stores  the\n              UTF-8 in the new extra fields otherwise.  The option\n\n                     u - UTF-8\n\n              as in\n\n                     zip archive dir -r -UN=UTF8\n\n              forces  zip  to store UTF-8 as native in the archive.  Note that\n              storing UTF-8 directly is the default on Unix systems that  sup-\n              port  it.   This option could be useful on Windows systems where\n              the escaped path is too large to be a valid path and  the  UTF-8\n              version of the path is smaller, but native UTF-8 is not backward\n              compatible on Windows systems.\n\n\n       -v\n       --verbose\n              Verbose mode or print diagnostic version info.\n\n              Normally, when applied to real operations, this  option  enables\n              the  display of a progress indicator during compression (see -dd\n              for more on dots) and requests  verbose  diagnostic  info  about\n              zipfile structure oddities.\n\n              However,  when -v is the only command line argument a diagnostic\n              screen is printed instead.  This should now work even if  stdout\n              is redirected to a file, allowing easy saving of the information\n              for sending with bug reports to Info-ZIP.   The  version  screen\n              provides  the help screen header with program name, version, and\n              release date, some pointers to the Info-ZIP home  and  distribu-\n              tion  sites,  and shows information about the target environment\n              (compiler type and version, OS version, compilation date and the\n              enabled optional features used to create the zip executable).\n\n       -V\n       --VMS-portable\n              [VMS]  Save VMS file attributes.  (Files are  truncated at EOF.)\n              When a -V archive is unpacked on a non-VMS  system,   some  file\n              types  (notably  Stream_LF  text  files   and  pure binary files\n              like fixed-512) should be extracted intact.  Indexed  files  and\n              file  types  with embedded record sizes (notably variable-length\n              record types) will probably be seen as corrupt elsewhere.\n\n       -VV\n       --VMS-specific\n              [VMS] Save VMS file attributes, and  all allocated blocks  in  a\n              file,   including  any  data beyond EOF.  Useful for moving ill-\n              formed files  among   VMS  systems.    When  a  -VV  archive  is\n              unpacked  on a non-VMS system, almost all files will appear cor-\n              rupt.\n\n       -w\n       --VMS-versions\n              [VMS] Append the version  number  of  the  files  to  the  name,\n              including  multiple  versions  of files.  Default is to use only\n              the most recent version of a specified file.\n\n       -ww\n       --VMS-dot-versions\n              [VMS] Append the version  number  of  the  files  to  the  name,\n              including  multiple  versions  of  files, using the .nnn format.\n              Default is to use only the most recent version  of  a  specified\n              file.\n\n       -ws\n       --wild-stop-dirs\n              Wildcards match only at a directory level.  Normally zip handles\n              paths as strings and given the paths\n\n                     /foo/bar/dir/file1.c\n\n                     /foo/bar/file2.c\n\n              an input pattern such as\n\n                     /foo/bar/*\n\n              normally would match both paths, the * matching dir/file1.c  and\n              file2.c.   Note  that in the first case a directory boundary (/)\n              was crossed in the match.  With -ws no directory bounds will  be\n              included  in  the  match,  making  wildcards local to a specific\n              directory level.  So, with -ws enabled,  only  the  second  path\n              would be matched.\n\n              When using -ws, use ** to match across directory boundaries as *\n              does normally.\n\n       -x <i>files</i>\n       --exclude <i>files</i>\n              Explicitly exclude the specified files, as in:\n\n                     zip -r foo foo -x \\*.o\n\n              which will include the contents of foo in foo.zip while  exclud-\n              ing  all  the  files  that  end in .o.  The backslash avoids the\n              shell filename substitution, so that the name matching  is  per-\n              formed by zip at all directory levels.\n\n              Also possible:\n\n                     zip -r foo foo -x@exclude.lst\n\n              which  will include the contents of foo in foo.zip while exclud-\n              ing  all  the  files  that  match  the  patterns  in  the   file\n              exclude.lst.\n\n              The long option forms of the above are\n\n                     zip -r foo foo --exclude \\*.o\n\n              and\n\n                     zip -r foo foo --exclude @exclude.lst\n\n              Multiple patterns can be specified, as in:\n\n                     zip -r foo foo -x \\*.o \\*.c\n\n              If  there is no space between -x and the pattern, just one value\n              is assumed (no list):\n\n                     zip -r foo foo -x\\*.o\n\n\n              See -i for more on include and exclude.\n\n       -X\n       --no-extra\n              Do not save extra file attributes (Extended Attributes on  OS/2,\n              uid/gid  and  file  times  on  Unix).  The zip format uses extra\n              fields to include additional information for each  entry.   Some\n              extra fields are specific to particular systems while others are\n              applicable to all systems.  Normally when zip reads entries from\n              an  existing archive, it reads the extra fields it knows, strips\n              the rest, and adds the extra fields applicable to  that  system.\n              With -X, zip strips all old fields and only includes the Unicode\n              and Zip64 extra fields (currently these two extra fields  cannot\n              be disabled).\n\n              Negating  this  option,  -X-,  includes  all  the  default extra\n              fields, but also copies over any unrecognized extra fields.\n\n       -y\n       --symlinks\n              For UNIX and VMS (V8.3 and later), store symbolic links as  such\n              in  the zip archive, instead of compressing and storing the file\n              referred to by the link.  This  can  avoid  multiple  copies  of\n              files  being  included in the archive as zip recurses the direc-\n              tory trees and accesses files directly and by links.\n\n       -z\n       --archive-comment\n              Prompt for a multi-line comment for the entire zip archive.  The\n              comment  is  ended by a line containing just a period, or an end\n              of file condition (^D on Unix, ^Z on MSDOS, OS/2, and VMS).  The\n              comment can be taken from a file:\n\n                     zip -z foo &lt; foowhat\n\n       -Z <i>cm</i>\n       --compression-method <i>cm</i>\n              Set  the default compression method.  Currently the main methods\n              supported by zip are store and deflate.  Compression method  can\n              be set to:\n\n              store  -  Setting  the compression method to store forces zip to\n              store entries with no compression.   This  is  generally  faster\n              than compressing entries, but results in no space savings.  This\n              is the same as using -0 (compression level zero).\n\n              deflate - This is the default method for zip.  If zip determines\n              that  storing is better than deflation, the entry will be stored\n              instead.\n\n              bzip2 - If bzip2 support is compiled in, this compression method\n              also  becomes available.  Only some modern unzips currently sup-\n              port the bzip2 compression method, so test the unzip you will be\n              using  before relying on archives using this method (compression\n              method 12).\n\n              For example, to add bar.c to archive foo  using  bzip2  compres-\n              sion:\n\n                     zip -Z bzip2 foo bar.c\n\n              The compression method can be abbreviated:\n\n                     zip -Zb foo bar.c\n\n\n       -#\n       (-0, -1, -2, -3, -4, -5, -6, -7, -8, -9)\n              Regulate  the  speed of compression using the specified digit #,\n              where -0 indicates no compression (store all  files),  -1  indi-\n              cates  the  fastest  compression speed (less compression) and -9\n              indicates the slowest compression  speed  (optimal  compression,\n              ignores the suffix list). The default compression level is -6.\n\n              Though  still  being  worked, the intention is this setting will\n              control compression speed for  all  compression  methods.   Cur-\n              rently only deflation is controlled.\n\n       -!\n       --use-privileges\n              [WIN32]  Use  priviliges  (if  granted) to obtain all aspects of\n              WinNT security.\n\n       -@\n       --names-stdin\n              Take the list of input files from standard input. Only one file-\n              name per line.\n\n       -$\n       --volume-label\n              [MSDOS,  OS/2,  WIN32]  Include  the  volume label for the drive\n              holding the first file to be compressed.  If you want to include\n              only  the  volume  label  or  to force a specific drive, use the\n              drive name as first file name, as in:\n\n                     zip -$ foo a: c:bar",
      "USE",
      "       Command format.  The basic command format is\n\n              zip options archive inpath inpath ...\n\n       where  archive  is a new or existing zip archive and inpath is a direc-\n       tory or file path optionally including wildcards.  When given the  name\n       of  an existing zip archive, zip will replace identically named entries\n       in the zip archive (matching the relative names as stored  in  the  ar-\n       chive)  or  add  entries for new names.  For example, if foo.zip exists\n       and contains foo/file1 and foo/file2, and the  directory  foo  contains\n       the files foo/file1 and foo/file3, then:\n\n              zip -r foo.zip foo\n\n       or more concisely\n\n              zip -r foo foo\n\n       will  replace foo/file1 in foo.zip and add foo/file3 to foo.zip.  After\n       this,  foo.zip  contains  foo/file1,  foo/file2,  and  foo/file3,  with\n       foo/file2 unchanged from before.\n\n       So if before the zip command is executed foo.zip has:\n\n               foo/file1 foo/file2\n\n       and directory foo has:\n\n               file1 file3\n\n       then foo.zip will have:\n\n               foo/file1 foo/file2 foo/file3\n\n       where foo/file1 is replaced and foo/file3 is new.\n\n       -@ file lists.   If  a file list is specified as -@ [Not on MacOS], zip\n       takes the list of input files from standard input instead of  from  the\n       command line.  For example,\n\n              zip -@ foo\n\n       will store the files listed one per line on stdin in foo.zip.\n\n       Under  Unix,  this option can be used to powerful effect in conjunction\n       with the find (1) command.  For example, to archive all  the  C  source\n       files in the current directory and its subdirectories:\n\n              find . -name \"*.[ch]\" -print | zip source -@\n\n       (note  that the pattern must be quoted to keep the shell from expanding\n       it).\n\n       Streaming input and output.  zip will also accept a single  dash  (\"-\")\n       as the zip file name, in which case it will write the zip file to stan-\n       dard output, allowing the output to be piped to  another  program.  For\n       example:\n\n              zip -r - . | dd of=/dev/nrst0 obs=16k\n\n       would  write the zip output directly to a tape with the specified block\n       size for the purpose of backing up the current directory.\n\n       zip also accepts a single dash (\"-\") as the name of a file to  be  com-\n       pressed,  in  which  case  it  will  read the file from standard input,\n       allowing zip to take input from another program. For example:\n\n              tar cf - . | zip backup -\n\n       would compress the output of the tar command for the purpose of backing\n       up  the  current  directory. This generally produces better compression\n       than the previous example using the -r  option  because  zip  can  take\n       advantage of redundancy between files. The backup can be restored using\n       the command\n\n              unzip -p backup | tar xf -\n\n       When no zip file name is given and stdout is not a terminal,  zip  acts\n       as  a filter, compressing standard input to standard output.  For exam-\n       ple,\n\n              tar cf - . | zip | dd of=/dev/nrst0 obs=16k\n\n       is equivalent to\n\n              tar cf - . | zip - - | dd of=/dev/nrst0 obs=16k\n\n       zip archives created in this manner can be extracted with  the  program\n       funzip  which  is  provided in the unzip package, or by gunzip which is\n       provided in the gzip package (but some gunzip do not support this if\n       zip used the Zip64 extensions). For example:\n\n              dd if=/dev/nrst0  ibs=16k | funzip | tar xvf -\n\n       The stream can also be saved to a file and unzip used.\n\n       If  Zip64  support  for  large files and archives is enabled and zip is\n       used as a filter, zip creates a Zip64 archive that requires a PKZIP 4.5\n       or  later compatible unzip to read it.  This is to avoid amgibuities in\n       the zip file structure as defined in the current zip  standard  (PKWARE\n       AppNote)  where  the decision to use Zip64 needs to be made before data\n       is written for the entry, but for a stream the size of the data is  not\n       known at that point.  If the data is known to be smaller than 4 GB, the\n       option -fz- can be used to prevent use of Zip64, but zip will exit with\n       an  error if Zip64 was in fact needed.  zip 3 and unzip 6 and later can\n       read archives with Zip64 entries.  Also, zip removes the  Zip64  exten-\n       sions  if  not  needed  when  archive  entries  are  copied (see the -U\n       (--copy) option).\n\n       When directing the output to another file, note that all options should\n       be before the redirection including -x.  For example:\n\n              zip archive \"*.h\" \"*.c\" -x donotinclude.h orthis.h &gt; tofile\n\n       Zip files.   When  changing  an  existing zip archive, zip will write a\n       temporary file with the new contents, and only replace the old one when\n       the  process  of  creating  the  new version has been completed without\n       error.\n\n       If the name of the zip archive  does  not  contain  an  extension,  the\n       extension  .zip  is  added.  If  the name already contains an extension\n       other than .zip, the existing extension is  kept  unchanged.   However,\n       split  archives  (archives  split over multiple files) require the .zip\n       extension on the last split.\n\n       Scanning and reading files.  When zip starts, it  scans  for  files  to\n       process  (if  needed).  If this scan takes longer than about 5 seconds,\n       zip will display  a  \"Scanning  files\"  message  and  start  displaying\n       progress  dots  every  2  seconds  or  every so many entries processed,\n       whichever takes longer.  If there is more than 2 seconds  between  dots\n       it  could indicate that finding each file is taking time and could mean\n       a slow network connection for example.  (Actually the initial file scan\n       is  a  two-step  process where the directory scan is followed by a sort\n       and these two steps are separated with a space in the dots.  If  updat-\n       ing an existing archive, a space also appears between the existing file\n       scan and the new file scan.)  The scanning  files  dots  are  not  con-\n       trolled  by the -ds dot size option, but the dots are turned off by the\n       -q quiet option.  The -sf show files option can be  used  to  scan  for\n       files  and  get  the  list of files scanned without actually processing\n       them.\n\n       If zip is not able to read a file, it issues a warning  but  continues.\n       See  the -MM option below for more on how zip handles patterns that are\n       not matched and files that  are  not  readable.   If  some  files  were\n       skipped, a warning is issued at the end of the zip operation noting how\n       many files were read and how many skipped.\n\n       Command modes.  zip now supports two distinct types of  command  modes,\n       external  and  internal.  The external modes (add, update, and freshen)\n       read files from the file system (as well as from an  existing  archive)\n       while  the  internal  modes  (delete  and  copy) operate exclusively on\n       entries in an existing archive.\n\n\n       add\n              Update existing entries and add new files.  If the archive  does\n              not exist create it.  This is the default mode.\n\n       update (-u)\n              Update  existing entries if newer on the file system and add new\n              files.  If the archive does not exist issue warning then  create\n              a new archive.\n\n       freshen (-f)\n              Update  existing entries of an archive if newer on the file sys-\n              tem.  Does not add new files to the archive.\n\n       delete (-d)\n              Select entries in an existing archive and delete them.\n\n       copy (-U)\n              Select entries in an existing archive and copy them to a new ar-\n              chive.  This new mode is similar to update but command line pat-\n              terns select entries in the existing archive rather  than  files\n              from  the  file system and it uses the --out option to write the\n              resulting archive to a new file rather than update the  existing\n              archive, leaving the original archive unchanged.\n\n       The new File Sync option (-FS) is also considered a new mode, though it\n       is similar to update.  This mode  synchronizes  the  archive  with  the\n       files  on  the OS, only replacing files in the archive if the file time\n       or size of the OS file is different, adding  new  files,  and  deleting\n       entries from the archive where there is no matching file.  As this mode\n       can delete entries from the archive, consider making a backup  copy  of\n       the archive.\n\n       Also see -DF for creating difference archives.\n\n       See  each option description below for details and the EXAMPLES section\n       below for examples.\n\n       Split archives.  zip version 3.0 and later can create  split  archives.\n       A  split  archive  is a standard zip archive split over multiple files.\n       (Note that split archives are not just archives split in to pieces,  as\n       the  offsets of entries are now based on the start of each split.  Con-\n       catenating the pieces together will invalidate these offsets, but unzip\n       can  usually  deal  with it.  zip will usually refuse to process such a\n       spliced archive unless the -FF fix option is used to fix the  offsets.)\n\n       One use of split archives is storing a large archive on multiple remov-\n       able media.  For a split archive with 20 split files the files are typ-\n       ically  named  (replace  ARCHIVE  with  the  name  of your archive) AR-\n       CHIVE.z01, ARCHIVE.z02, ..., ARCHIVE.z19, ARCHIVE.zip.  Note  that  the\n       last  file  is  the  .zip  file.  In contrast, spanned archives are the\n       original multi-disk archive generally requiring floppy disks and  using\n       volume  labels  to store disk numbers.  zip supports split archives but\n       not spanned archives, though a procedure exists  for  converting  split\n       archives  of  the  right size to spanned archives.  The reverse is also\n       true, where each file of a spanned archive can be copied  in  order  to\n       files with the above names to create a split archive.\n\n       Use  -s  to set the split size and create a split archive.  The size is\n       given as a number followed optionally by one of k (kB), m (MB), g (GB),\n       or  t (TB) (the default is m).  The -sp option can be used to pause zip\n       between splits to allow changing removable media, for example, but read\n       the descriptions and warnings for both -s and -sp below.\n\n       Though  zip does not update split archives, zip provides the new option\n       -O (--output-file or --out) to allow split archives to be  updated  and\n       saved in a new archive.  For example,\n\n              zip inarchive.zip foo.c bar.c --out outarchive.zip\n\n       reads  archive  inarchive.zip,  even if split, adds the files foo.c and\n       bar.c, and writes the resulting archive to  outarchive.zip.   If  inar-\n       chive.zip is split then outarchive.zip defaults to the same split size.\n       Be aware that if outarchive.zip and any split files  that  are  created\n       with  it  already exist, these are always overwritten as needed without\n       warning.  This might be changed in the future.\n\n       Unicode.  Though the zip standard requires storing paths in an  archive\n       using  a  specific character set, in practice zips have stored paths in\n       archives in whatever the local character set is.  This creates problems\n       when  an  archive is created or updated on a system using one character\n       set and then extracted on another system using  a  different  character\n       set.  When compiled with Unicode support enabled on platforms that sup-\n       port wide characters, zip now stores, in addition to the standard local\n       path  for  backward  compatibility,  the UTF-8 translation of the path.\n       This provides a common universal character set for storing  paths  that\n       allows  these paths to be fully extracted on other systems that support\n       Unicode and to match as close as possible on systems that don't.\n\n       On Win32 systems where paths are internally stored as Unicode but  rep-\n       resented in the local character set, it's possible that some paths will\n       be skipped during a local character set directory scan.  zip with  Uni-\n       code support now can read and store these paths.  Note that Win 9x sys-\n       tems and FAT file systems don't fully support Unicode.\n\n       Be aware that console windows on Win32 and Unix, for example, sometimes\n       don't  accurately  show all characters due to how each operating system\n       switches in character sets for display.  However, directory  navigation\n       tools should show the correct paths if the needed fonts are loaded.\n\n       Command line format.  This version of zip has updated command line pro-\n       cessing and support for long options.\n\n       Short options take the form\n\n              -s[-][s[-]...][value][=value][ value]\n\n       where s is a one or two character short option.  A  short  option  that\n       takes  a value is last in an argument and anything after it is taken as\n       the value.  If the option can be negated and  \"-\"  immediately  follows\n       the  option, the option is negated.  Short options can also be given as\n       separate arguments\n\n              -s[-][value][=value][ value] -s[-][value][=value][ value] ...\n\n       Short options in general take values either as part of the  same  argu-\n       ment  or  as  the following argument.  An optional = is also supported.\n       So\n\n              -ttmmddyyyy\n\n       and\n\n              -tt=mmddyyyy\n\n       and\n\n              -tt mmddyyyy\n\n       all work.  The -x and -i options accept  lists  of  values  and  use  a\n       slightly  different format described below.  See the -x and -i options.\n\n       Long options take the form\n\n              --longoption[-][=value][ value]\n\n       where the option starts with --, has a multicharacter name, can include\n       a  trailing  dash to negate the option (if the option supports it), and\n       can have a value (option argument) specified by preceeding  it  with  =\n       (no spaces).  Values can also follow the argument.  So\n\n              --before-date=mmddyyyy\n\n       and\n\n              --before-date mmddyyyy\n\n       both work.\n\n       Long option names can be shortened to the shortest unique abbreviation.\n       See the option descriptions below for which support long  options.   To\n       avoid confusion, avoid abbreviating a negatable option with an embedded\n       dash (\"-\") at the dash if you plan to negate it (the parser would  con-\n       sider  a  trailing  dash,  such  as  for the option --some-option using\n       --some- as the option, as part of  the  name  rather  than  a  negating\n       dash).   This  can  be  changed to force the last dash in --some- to be\n       negating in the future.\n\nEXAMPLES\n\n       The simplest example:\n\n              zip stuff *\n\n       creates the archive stuff.zip (assuming it does not exist) and puts all\n       the  files in the current directory in it, in compressed form (the .zip\n       suffix is added automatically, unless the archive name contains  a  dot\n       already; this allows the explicit specification of other suffixes).\n\n       Because  of the way the shell on Unix does filename substitution, files\n       starting with \".\" are not included; to include these as well:\n\n              zip stuff .* *\n\n       To create a password protected archive:\n\n              zip -e stuff.zip file1 file2\n\n       Even this will not include any subdirectories from the  current  direc-\n       tory.\n\n       To zip up an entire directory, the command:\n\n              zip -r foo foo\n\n       creates  the  archive foo.zip, containing all the files and directories\n       in the directory foo that is contained within the current directory.\n\n       You might want to make a zip archive that  contains  the  files  in  foo,\n       without  recording  the directory name, foo.  You can use the -j option\n       to leave off the paths, as in:\n\n              zip -j foo foo/*\n\n       If you are short on disk space, you might not have enough room to  hold\n       both  the  original  directory and the corresponding compressed zip ar-\n       chive.  In this case, you can create the archive in steps using the  -m\n       option.   If  foo contains the subdirectories tom, dick, and harry, you\n       can:\n\n              zip -rm foo foo/tom\n              zip -rm foo foo/dick\n              zip -rm foo foo/harry\n\n       where the first command creates foo.zip, and the next two  add  to  it.\n       At  the  completion  of  each  zip command, the last created archive is\n       deleted, making room for the next zip command to function.\n\n\n       Use -s to set the split size and create a split archive.  The  size  is\n       given as a number followed optionally by one of k (kB), m (MB), g (GB),\n       or t (TB).  The command\n\n              zip -s 2g -r split.zip foo\n\n       creates a split archive of the directory foo with splits no bigger than\n       2 GB  each.   If  foo  contained 5 GB of contents and the contents were\n       stored in the split archive without compression (to make  this  example\n       simple),  this  would create three splits, split.z01 at 2 GB, split.z02\n       at 2 GB, and split.zip at a little over 1 GB.\n\n       The -sp option can be used to pause zip between splits to allow  chang-\n       ing  removable  media, for example, but read the descriptions and warn-\n       ings for both -s and -sp below.\n\n       Though zip does not update split archives, zip provides the new  option\n       -O (--output-file) to allow split archives to be updated and saved in a\n       new archive.  For example,\n\n              zip inarchive.zip foo.c bar.c --out outarchive.zip\n\n       reads archive inarchive.zip, even if split, adds the  files  foo.c  and\n       bar.c,  and  writes  the resulting archive to outarchive.zip.  If inar-\n       chive.zip is split then outarchive.zip defaults to the same split size.\n       Be  aware that outarchive.zip and any split files that are created with\n       it are always overwritten without warning.  This might be changed in the\n       future.\n\n       To list the files inside an archive:\n              unzip -l a.zip\n\nPATTERN MATCHING\n\n       This  section  applies  only  to Unix.  Watch this space for details on\n       MSDOS and VMS operation.  However, the special  wildcard  characters  *\n       and [] below apply to at least MSDOS also.\n\n       The  Unix  shells (sh, csh, bash, and others) normally do filename sub-\n       stitution (also called \"globbing\") on command arguments.  Generally the\n       special characters are:\n\n       ?      match any single character\n\n       *      match any number of characters (including none)\n\n       []     match  any  character in the range indicated within the brackets\n              (example: [a-f], [0-9]).  This form of wildcard matching  allows\n              a  user  to specify a list of characters between square brackets\n              and if any of the characters match the expression matches.   For\n              example:\n\n                     zip archive \"*.[hc]\"\n\n              would  archive all files in the current directory that end in .h\n              or .c.\n\n              Ranges of characters are supported:\n\n                     zip archive \"[a-f]*\"\n\n              would add to the archive all files  starting  with  \"a\"  through\n              \"f\".\n\n              Negation is also supported, where any character in that position\n              not in the list matches.  Negation is supported by adding ! or ^\n              to the beginning of the list:\n\n                     zip archive \"*.[!o]\"\n\n              matches files that don't end in \".o\".\n\n              On  WIN32, [] matching needs to be turned on with the -RE option\n              to avoid the confusion that names with [ or ] have caused.\n\n\n       When these characters are encountered (without  being  escaped  with  a\n       backslash  or  quotes),  the  shell will look for files relative to the\n       current path that match the pattern, and replace the  argument  with  a\n       list of the names that matched.\n\n       The  zip  program can do the same matching on names that are in the zip\n       archive being modified or, in the  case  of  the  -x  (exclude)  or  -i\n       (include)  options,  on  the  list of files to be operated on, by using\n       backslashes or quotes to tell the shell not to do the  name  expansion.\n       In  general,  when zip encounters a name in the list of files to do, it\n       first looks for the name in the file system.  If it finds it,  it  then\n       adds  it  to the list of files to do.  If it does not find it, it looks\n       for the name in the zip archive being modified (if  it  exists),  using\n       the  pattern matching characters described above, if present.  For each\n       match, it will add that name to the list  of  files  to  be  processed,\n       unless  this  name  matches  one  given with the -x option, or does not\n       match any name given with the -i option.\n\n       The pattern matching includes the path, and so patterns like \\*.o match\n       names  that  end in \".o\", no matter what the path prefix is.  Note that\n       the backslash must precede every special character (i.e. ?*[]), or  the\n       entire argument must be enclosed in double quotes (\"\").\n\n       In  general, use backslashes or double quotes for paths that have wild-\n       cards to make zip do the pattern matching for file  paths,  and  always\n       for paths and strings that have spaces or wildcards for -i, -x, -R, -d,\n       and -U and anywhere zip needs to process the wildcards.\n\nENVIRONMENT\n\n       The following environment  variables  are  read  and  used  by  zip  as\n       described.\n\n       ZIPOPT\n              contains  default  options  that  will be used when running zip.\n              The contents of this environment variable will get added to  the\n              command line just after the zip command.\n\n       ZIP\n              [Not on RISC OS and VMS] see ZIPOPT\n\n       Zip$Options\n              [RISC OS] see ZIPOPT\n\n       Zip$Exts\n              [RISC  OS]  contains extensions separated by a : that will cause\n              native filenames with one of  the  specified  extensions  to  be\n              added to the zip file with basename and extension swapped.\n\n       ZIP_OPTS\n              [VMS] see ZIPOPT\n\nExit codes:\n\n   0      normal; no errors or warnings detected.\n\n   2      unexpected end of zip file.\n\n   3      a generic error in the zipfile format was detected.\n          Processing may have completed successfully anyway;\n          some broken zipfiles created by other archivers have simple workarounds.\n\n   4      zip was unable to allocate memory for one or more buffers\n          during program initialization.\n\n   5      a severe error in the zipfile format was detected.\n          Processing probably failed immediately.\n\n   6      entry  too  large  to  be  processed (such as input files\n          larger than 2 GB when not using Zip64 or trying  to  read\n          an existing archive that is too large) or entry too large\n          to be split with zipsplit\n\n   7      invalid comment format\n\n   8      zip -T failed or out of memory\n\n   9      the user cancelled zip prematurely with control-C (or similar)\n\n   10     zip encountered an error while using a temp file\n\n   11     read or seek error\n\n   12     zip has nothing to do\n\n   13     missing or empty zip file\n\n   14     error writing to a file\n\n   15     zip was unable to create a file to write to\n\n   16     bad command line parameters\n\n   18     zip could not open a specified file to read\n\n   19     zip  was compiled with options not supported on this system"
